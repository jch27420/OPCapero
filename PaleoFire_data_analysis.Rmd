### Method 1
### Data-binning procedure used to calculate a composite curve.
### Binning sequence must be supplied for 'pfComposite' function to calculate
### 'mean' charcoal value per series within each binning interval
### Mean is then calculated for all series
### Below 500 yr bin width is used for span of 11,000 yrs

### CI for 'pfComposite' function calculated by bootstrap re-sampling of
### binned charcoal series and calculation of the mean for each bin n times,
### using the argument 'nboot' (by default => nboot=1000).

COMP1a <- pfComposite(TR1, binning=TRUE, bins=seq(from=0,to=11000, by=500))

```


```{r}
comparison=pfKruskal(COMP1a)

```

### Method 2 - Two-stage smoothing method:
### (i) "pre-bin" individual charcoal series using non-overlapping bins
### to ensure high sample resolution records do not create bias and
### not be interpolated for records with lower resolution
### (ii) smooth pre-binned series using a locally-weighted scatter plot
### smoother "LOWESS" with pre-defined constant bandwidth (half-width)
### given in years (hw argument)
### Note: 20 yr non-overlapping bins, LOWESS smoother 500 yr window hw of
### 1000-yr smoothing window.
### 'tarAge' => defines center of each bin (binhw being the pre-binning
### bin half width) and ages for LOWESS estim. takes place (i.e. -50 to 12,000)
###
### 'pfCompositeLF' function ==> CIs calculated by bootstrap re-sampling
### the pre-binned series (as opposed to individual samples) and then applying
### LOWESS curve fitting. Repeated n times using 'nboot'
### CIs estimated based on the distrib. of bootstrap replicates.

COMP1b <- pfCompositeLF(TR1, tarAge=seq(-50,12000,20), binhw=10, hw=500, nboot=1000)
```

### because the values in charcoal series are auto-correlated, testing the
### significance of their temporal variations is not straight-forward.
### Circular function ==> "moving" or "circular" block bootstrap, which
### consists of splitting each charcoal series into (n-b+1) overlapping blocks
### of data (n = sample size, b = block size). Blocks are randomly selected
### (with replacement) to reconstruct new individual charcoal series that are
### then used to estimate the CIs around the charcoal series composite mean.
### This procedure may dampen the long-term trends in data, particularly if
### individual sites record opposing trends
### If observed trend does not exceed the CIs then there the composite values
### at that time are not greater than by chance if records are not at all
### synchronized. However, a composite curve not exceeding the CIs does not 
### exclude the occurrence of important trends in the composite series.
### This procedure is used for testing significance of local minima or maxima
### in the composite time series.

### Circular block bootstrap method commonly used in Superposed Epoch Analysis
### a compositing technique that aims to find the response of a variable to
### one or multiple particular events (e.g. insect outbreaks, fire) using
### dendrochronological series or paleoecological proxy series

### Note: b=NULL argument indicates that the block size is automatically
### calculated for each series using the formulation above.
