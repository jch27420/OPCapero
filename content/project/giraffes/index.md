<div><center><h2>THE ALLURE OF MILKWEEDS</h2></centre></div>  

&nbsp; &nbsp; We have long been taught to despise weeds. They compete with crops for precious nutrients, often reducing their yields in the process. Moreover, they are hard to manage or eradicate. So it is perhaps no surprise that Milk*weed*, the common name given to plants belonging to the genus *Asclepias*, are demonized by most people. The so called *weediness* of these plants is due, in large part, to the ability of some Milkweed species to colonize road sides and other disturbed areas. However, this characterization is misleading due to the fact that many species of *Asclepias* are important sources of food, fibre and medicine.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; We have learned from **First Nations** people that different parts of the **Milkweed** plant can be used for many purposes. For example, the tough stem fibres can be used to make cordage. By simply rubbing the inner stem fibres together between your hands (i.e. *twining* the fibres) one can make a cord. Although most **Milkweeds** are suitable for making cordage, **<a class="one" href="https://explorer.natureserve.org/Taxon/ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.129944/Asclepias_incarnata">Swamp Milkweed</a>**  (*Asclepias incarnata*) is preferred due to its very tough fibers. **Milkweed** is also edible. The young leaves, shoots and stems of **<a class="one" href="https://explorer.natureserve.org/Taxon/ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.131135/Asclepias_syriaca">Common Milkweed</a>** (*Asclepias syriaca*), as well as its flower buds, roots and young pods are all considered quite delicious and nutritious greens. **First Nations** people also knew of the healing properties of **Milkweeds**. For example, many parts of the plant, including its **latex**, were used to treat among other things: **(i)** body aches (e.g. back, chest, stomach); **(ii)** venereal diseases and fungal infections (e.g. *ringworm*); and **(iii)** *dropsy* -- a build up of body fluid (aka *edema*) commonly associated with congestive heart failure.**<sup>1,2</sup>** Today, we now know that <span id="Blue">C</span>ardiac <span id="Blue">G</span>lycosides (<span id="Blue">CG</span>) found in the **latex** of these plants is responsible for its toxic and medicinal (at appropriate doses) affects on cardiac muscle. Perhaps, not surprisingly, the toxic **latex** was put to good use by many indigenous tribes in Africa and South America to make poison-tipped arrows. Despite its poisonous reputation, **Milkweeds** also provide many other valuable *ecosystem goods* and *services*.**<sup>3</sup>** For example, the hollow filament-like hairs attached to the seeds, commonly referred to as *coma*, "*floss*" or simply "*silk*", are not only hypoallergenic but warmer than wool and more buoyant than cork. Moreover, the fine, silky quality of the *coma* (aka: *American silk*) inspired early French settlers (17<sup>th</sup> century) to make beautiful cloth. Besides the aesthetic qualities of *coma*, its buoyant properties were also put to good use by the Allies during the Second World War as a substitute for *kapok* (aka: "*Java cotton*", from the Kapok tree *Ceiba pentandra*) to make life jackets. The warm and hypo-allergenic properties of **Milkweed** *coma* have also been put to good use in the making of linen and garments (e.g. **<a class="one" href="https://www.ogallalacomfort.com/">Ogallala Comfort</a>**). Not to be out done, the hollow fibres of the *coma* are also highly oil-absorbent and therefore useful for treating oil spills. Lastly, from an ecological view point, **Milkweeds** are host to many insect species, including the emblematic **Monarch Butterfly**. The large volumes of nectar produced by these plants serves as a vital food source for many pollinating insects as well as hummingbirds.**<sup>4</sup>** Moreover, the presence of certain types of <span id="Blue">CG</span> within **Milkweed** species appears to be preferentially selected by parasite-infected Monarch butterflies to help their offspring survive (i.e. *trans-generational* medication)!**<sup>5</sup>** Lastly, quite a few passerines like the **<a class="one" href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Baltimore_Oriole">Baltimore Oriole</a>** (*Icterus galbula*) and **<a class="one" href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Goldfinch/">American Goldfinch</a>** (*Spinus tristis*) use Milkweed floss and/or fibre to build their nests. So, given the wealth of things **Milkweeds** provide -- *why would we not cultivate them*?

<!----------------- SECTION 1 - OPC MILKWEED POPULATION ----------------->
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a id="Mkw_Pop"></a>**1. <u>MILKWEED POPULATION</u>:** *Asclepias spp.* are a large family (>70 species) of North American forbs (see **<a class="one" href="https://plants.sc.egov.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=ASCLE">USDA</a>**), with 12 species being native to Ontario. Of these dozen *Asclepias* species only seven have historically been found at <span id="Blue">OPC</span>. However, one species (i.e. White Milkweed) is now believed to be *extirpated* (i.e. extinct from region, [Read more about S and G Species Rankings](#sgranks)).

<!------------------- SECTION 2: MILKWEED HABITAT----------------->
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<a id="Mkw_Hab"></a>**2.<u>HABITAT</u>:** **Milkweeds** that are native to <span id="Blue">OPC</span> are perennial, herbaceous plants that inhabit a variety of wet and dry areas, ranging from roadside ditches and swamps to shorelines and forests. Some species, notably *A. syriaca*, readily colonize disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Regardless, one should always consult reliable databases for the preferred habitat of each species (**<a class="one" href="https://plants.sc.egov.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=ASCLE)">USDA</a>**, or **<a class="one" href="https://www.itis.gov/">ITIS</a>**).  

<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<!---------- MILKWEED FAMILY SECTION 3: PLANT MORPH ----------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<a id="Mkw_Morph"></a>**3. <u>MILKWEED MORPHOLOGY \& FEATURES</u>:** **Milkweeds**, as the name suggests, are known for their sticky, often *creamy white* (but can be yellow, orange or clear) **latex** that is exuded in response to tissue damage. Closer examination of **latex** shows that it is unlike plant **sap** or **resin** in a number of ways. Firstly, **sap** is an aqueous solution that is transported by the plant's well known vasculature elements (xylem and phloem), while **resins** are a fat-soluble mixture of largely volatile <span id="Dred">Terpenoids</span> and <span id="Dred">Phenolics</span> found within *inter*-cellular spaces, or ducts.**<sup>6</sup>** By contrast, **latex** is produced and stored (under pressure) in *living cells* known as **lactifers**. These elongated and branching cells form *unique* tubular networks throughout most of the plant (i.e. independent of the vascular bundles). In addition, **latex** is an <u>emulsion</u>, or *colloidal* solution that has microscopic particles of **<a class="one" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6557">polyisoprene</a>** (i.e. *natural rubber*) suspended within an aqueous solution.**<sup>7-9</sup>**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to *natural rubber*, **latex** contains a wide variety of *bioactive* compounds that make the plant inedible to most animals.**<sup>8-10</sup>** The most notable of these bioactive compounds are the <span id="Blue">C</span>ardiac <span id="Blue">G</span>lycosides (<span id="Blue">CG</span>), digestive <span id="Dred">Proteases</span> and <span id="Dred">Phenolics</span>. However, some herbivores, notably Monarch caterpillars (*Danaus plexoppus*), are *obligate* feeders of Milkweed. In fact, this specialization on Milkweed plants has been adopted by over 100 insect species, largely as a mode of chemical defense against predators.**<sup>11</sup>** In addition to the plant's characteristic sticky **latex**, **Milkweeds** have unique flowers and pod-like fruits. The latter are packed with silky <u>haired</u> seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal (also buoyant in water), while the flowers display very distinctive and complex features (**Fig. 1**).

<figcaption>
<b>Figure 1: Milkweed Flower Structure.</b> <b>(A)</b> The <b>pollinarium</b> is a <i>winged</i> or "<i>wishbone</i>" shaped structure that contains two discrete sacs of pollen, or <b>pollinium</b>, that are joined to a central disc-like <b>corpusculum</b> via the <i>arms</i> of the <b>translator</b>. <b>(B)</b> This cartoon shows an overhead view of the shape and position of the flower elements, including the <i>coronal</i> <b>hood</b> and <b>horn</b> (nectar reservoir) and the position of the <b>corpusculum</b> in relation to the much larger <b>gynostegium</b> (<sup>&#9734;</sup>fused female <b>stigma</b> and male <b>anther</b>). <b>(C)</b> This picture of Purple Milkweed flowers shows some of its floral elements, including 5 backward pointing (reflected) petals that make up the <b>corolla</b>.  
</figcaption>
</figure>  

&nbsp; &nbsp; **Milkweed** flowers are arranged in either flat-topped or round clusters called *umbels* (i.e. latin *umbella*: "*a sunshade, parasol or umbrella*"). Individual flowers have two distinctive parts -- a lower <u>*corolla*</u> and upper <u>*corona*</u> (**Fig. 1**). The lower *corolla* is made up of 5 backward-pointing (usually) petals, while the upper nectar containing *corona* is composed (usually) of 5 pairs of <u>*hoods*</u> and <u>*horns*</u>. The *hoods* extend from the base of the *stamens* and house a horn-like appendage (nectar reservoir) that arches over top of a central *gem*-like *gynostegium* (fused female *stigma* and male *anthers*). This unusual flower structure results in an equally unusual pollination mechanism. Like orchids, the pollen of **Milkweed** is packaged into discrete units called <u>*pollinia*</u>. They are part of *wishbone*-like structure called a <u>*pollinarium*</u> that contains a pair of *pollinium*, a <u>*translator*</u> and <u>*corpusculum*</u>.**<sup>4</sup>** The *pollinia* are connected to the *corpusculum*, a small disc-like gland at the base of the "*wishbone*", via the forking "*arms*" of the *translator*. Visually, the *corpusculum* (apex of the *pollinarium*) sits atop a narrow opening (<u>*alar fissure*</u>) into the <u>*stigmatic chamber*</u>, which houses the *pollinarium* (**Fig. 1**). When the leg of a feeding insect slips between the *hoods* and comes into contact with the *corpusculum* it can free the *pollinia* and carry it to other **Milkweed** plants. Given the arduous nature of the **<a class="one" href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/pollinators/importance.shtml">pollination</a>** process, only relatively large insects are capable of carrying out this task.

</figure>

This beautiful plant is noted for its flat-top umbel arrangements of the small orange flowers. The flowers of this species have a typical *hood* and *horn* corona structure. Other distinctive features of this plant include a hairy stem and alternatively arranged leaves.

**POPULATION \& HABITAT:** **<a class="one" href="https://explorer.natureserve.org/Taxon/ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.129775/Asclepias_tuberosa">Butterfly Milkweed</a>** (*aka* Orange Milkweed) is one of the few native orange wildflowers, making it relatively easy to spot when it blooms (mid-to-late June) in areas containing open sandy soils. Its a relatively common plant at **<span id="Blue">OPC</span>** where it grows singly or in small clusters. This forb is only found in Ontario and Quebec (rare) within Canada. Unfortunately in Ontario populations of *Asclepias tuberosa* are under threat by the loss/fragmentation of habitat (i.e. prairie and savannas) and the suppression of regenerative surface fires. It is also found in many other parts of eastern North America, but its status varies from region to region. In fact in many American states its status appears to be largely unknown.**<sup>12</sup>**

**ECOLOGICAL \& MEDICINAL PROPERTIES:** **Butterfly Milkweed** is an important indicator species of healthy prairie habitats with reported medicinal properties (**Note:** the genus, *Asclepias*, refers to the Greek god of medicine *Asklepios*). **First Nations People** were known to chew the plant root as a cure for pleurisy and other pulmonary ailments, as well as make tea to treat diarrhea and stomach ailments. From an evolutionary perspective, the flat-top *umbel* arrangement of the flowers provides a convenient resting platform for pollinating insects to feed on its nectar. This is just one co-evolutionary strategy that plants have adapted to promote insect pollination.**<sup>13</sup>**

</figure>

**POPULATION \& HABITAT:** **<a class="one" href="https://explorer.natureserve.org/Taxon/ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.145205/Asclepias_purpurascens">Purple Milkweed</a>** is a native perennial forb of eastern North America and considered a key indicator species for oak savannas. Although its habitat requirements are not particularly restrictive they seem to prefer the partly shaded areas of Oak savannas at **<span id="Blue">OPC</span>** where it grows singly or in fairly low numbers. In Ontario its status is critically imperiled (<span id="Red">S1</span>). In many other parts of its range its status is either vulnerable (<span id="Blue">S3</span>), imperiled (<span id="Dred">S2</span>), critically imperiled (<span id="Red">S1</span>) or simply not known. There are only a few eastern states where its population appears to be secure. Obviously its populations would benefit from further protective measures (i.e. habitat restoration).**<sup>12</sup>**  

**ECOLOGICAL \& MEDICINAL PROPERTIES:** Similar to other **Milkweeds**, *Asclepias purpurascens L.* attracts many type of pollinator species, including (among others) bees, butterflies and hummingbirds. They have a common flower structure (i.e. *corolla* - 5 reflected petals, *corona* - 5 pairs of hoods and curved horns) and like many other **Milkweeds** produce a white latex that contains toxic **<span id="Blue">CG</span>**.**<sup>13</sup>**

</figure>

**POPULATION \& HABITAT:** **<a class="one" href="https://explorer.natureserve.org/Taxon/ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.129944/Asclepias_incarnata">Swamp Milkweed</a>** (*aka* Pleurisy Root) like other species in this family, is a native perennial forb that is found in may parts of North America. As its name implies this *Ascelpias* species prefers moist habitats (e.g. wet meadows, marshes, the banks of rivers and streams), but is also found in drier areas such as fields and prairies.**<sup>12</sup>**

**ECOLOGICAL \& MEDICINAL PROPERTIES:** *A. incarnata* is the preferred food of Monarch Butterfly (*Danaus plexippus*) caterpillars and an important source of nectar for pollinators, including hummingbirds. The young shoots and seed pods, as well as the flower buds are all edible. Extracts of the root and other plant parts have been used as an emetic (i.e. induce vomiting), diuretic (i.e. promote urination) and a anti-helminth (i.e. purge parasitic worms). It is also commonly referred to as Pleurisy Root for its use in the treatment of lung problems. As mentioned previously, it is the preferred Milkweed species for making cordage and twine due to its very tough stem fibres.**<sup>13</sup>**

**POPULATION \& HABITAT:** *Asclepias syriaca* is a native perennial forb that is common to eastern North America, but a rare inhabitant of the Midwest. It is known to colonize disturbed areas, like roadsides, but can also be found in open fields and pastures.**<sup>12</sup>**  

**ECOLOGICAL \& MEDICINAL PROPERTIES:** This Milkweed species is a food source for many insects and animals, including humans. The nectar of these plants attracts many insect species and hummingbirds. Its toxic latex-laden leaves is food source for many specialized insects, especially the larvae of Monarch Butterflies and red Milkweed beetles (*Tetraopes tetrophthalmus*). As mentioned previously, its young stems, flower buds and seed pods are all edible when properly prepared.**<sup>13</sup>**  

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

<a id="GSrank"></a>
**GLOBAL \& REGIONAL RANKINGS:**  
**GRANKS** (**G**, global rankings) and **SRANKS** (**S**, State/Province rankings) provide designations for floral and ecosystem abundance. They are assigned and maintained by several conservation agencies. The following general rankings are from **<a class="one" href="https://explorer.natureserve.org/AboutTheData/DataTypes/ConservationStatusCategories">NatureServe</a>**:  
<span id="Red">GX: Presumed Extinct/Collapsed</span>: **Species** <u>presumed extinct</u>, not located despite intensive searches and virtually no likelihood of rediscovery. **Ecosystem** <u>presumed collapsed</u> throughout its range, due to loss of key dominant and characteristic taxa and/or elimination of the sites and ecological processes on which the type depends.  
<span id="Red">GH - Possibly Extinct/Collapsed</span>: **Species** or **Ecosystem** is known from only historical occurrences, but still some hope of rediscovery. Examples of evidence include (1) that a species has not been documented in approximately 20-40 years in human-dominated landscapes despite some searching and/or some evidence of significant habitat loss or degradation; (2) that a species or ecosystem has been searched for unsuccessfully, but not thoroughly enough to presume that it is extinct or collapsed throughout its range.  
<span id="Red">G1 - Critically Imperiled</span>: At very high risk of extinction or collapse due to very restricted range, very few populations or occurrences, very steep declines, very severe threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Dred">G2 - Imperiled</span>: At high risk of extinction or collapse due to restricted range, few populations or occurrences, steep declines, severe threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Blue">G3 - Vulnerable</span>: At moderate risk of extinction or collapse due to a fairly restricted range, relatively few populations or occurrences, recent and widespread declines, threats, or other factors.  
**G4 - Apparently Secure**: At fairly low risk of extinction or collapse due to an extensive range and/or many populations or occurrences, but with possible cause for some concern as a result of local recent declines, threats, or other factors.  
**G5 - Secure**: At very low risk or extinction or collapse due to a very extensive range, abundant populations or occurrences, and little to no concern from declines or threats.  

**GRANK**s and **SRANK**s may also include other designations, notably: **GU** (uncertain global ranking); **G?** (tentative ranking); **Q** (questionable taxonomic status of the species, subspecies, or variety); **T** (rank applies to a subspecies or variety); and **HYB** (hybrid of 2 species); **SH** (plant historically occurred in Ontario, but has not been recorded in the last 20 years); **SR** (plant has been reported without persuasive documentation); **SU** (species has no SRANK value and therefore of uncertain status); **SX** (species apparently extirpated from Ontario with little likelihood of rediscovery); **SE** (species is exotic, not native to Ontario); **?** (some uncertainty about an assigned rank). Rank ranges (e.g. **S1S2**) indicate the uncertain nature of the species rank (i.e. either **S1** or **S2**).  

**MNR RISK STATUS:** This code is assigned by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (**OMNR**) and is based on recommendations by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario. The designated categories are as follows:  
<span id="Red">END</span>**:** Any indigenous species that is threatened with immediate extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its Ontario range.  
<span id="Red">THR</span>**:** Any indigenous species that is experiencing a definite non-cyclical decline throughout all or a major portion of its Ontario range.  
<span id="Red">VUL</span>**:** Any indigenous species that has relatively stable populations, and/or that occurs sporadically, or in a very restricted area of Ontario, or is at the fringe of its range.  

**COSEWIC:** Risk codes developed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada include:  
<span id="Red">END</span>**:** Any indigenous flora that is threatened with imminent extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its Canadian range.  
<span id="Red">EXP</span>**:** Any indigenous flora that no longer exists in the wild in Canada but can occur elsewhere.  
<span id="Red">THR</span>**:** Any indigenous flora that is likely to become endangered in Canada if the factors affecting its vulnerability are not reversed.  
<span id="Red">VUL</span>**:** Any indigenous flora that is particularly at risk because of low or declining numbers, occurrence at the fringe of its range or in restricted areas, or for some other reason, but is not yet threatened.
