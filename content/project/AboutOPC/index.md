&nbsp; &nbsp; <span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) was once home to the town of Ojibway, which was annexed by the city of Windsor in 1966. This ~350 hectare (ha) complex is made up of five parcels of land: (i) **Ojibway Park** (~61.5 ha); (ii) **Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve** (105 ha); (iii) **Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** (~15.6 ha); (iv) **Spring Garden ANSI** (~117 ha); and (v) **Black Oak Heritage Park** (~50.6 ha)[@noauthor_ojibway_2019]. Collectively they are home to more than 160 species of provincially rare plants and animals, more than any other site in Ontario. Arguably it is one of Canada's most treasured natural areas.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is one of only three major **[Tallgrass Communities](https://tallgrassontario.org/wp-site/)** remaining in the province, with the other two being found in and around **W**alpole **I**sland **F**irst **N**ations (<span id="Blue">WIFN</span>, ~850 ha) and **P**inery **P**rovincial **P**ark (<span id="Blue">PPP</span>, ~1250 ha). Together these three areas are thought to account for ~90% of the provinceâ€™s existing <span id="Fgr">T</span>all<span id="Fgr">G</span>rass <span id="Fgr">C</span>ommunities (<span id="Fgr">TGC</span>). Historically, Southern Ontario is thought to have contained upwards of 200,000 ha (2,000 km&#178;) of Tallgrass Communities.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Ontario's ecological land classification systems, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> lies within the **[Southern Great Lakes lowland forests](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ecosystems-ontario-part-1-ecozones-and-ecoregions)** <span id="Gr2">ecoregion</span> of the much larger **Mixedwood Plains** <span id="Gr2">ecozone</span>. And like other parts of the province, the landscape of <span id="Dred">OPC</span> has been largely shaped by glacial ice and water between 75,000-to-10,000 years ago (i.e. late [Wisconsin glacial period](https://opentextbc.ca/geology/chapter/16-1-glacial-periods-in-earths-history/)). The original topsoil of this region was removed by the enormous grinding and scraping forces generated by the advancing glaciers. Over time the bedrock became covered by thick layers of unconsolidated material (i.e. [surficial geology](https://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/en/mines-and-minerals/geoscience/surficial-geology)) often through the action of glacial meltwater. For <span id="Dred">OPC</span> the large glacial lakes that once inundated the region left behind a large low-relief plain of sandy and clay-like material known as the **St. Clair Clay Plain**. These glacial deposits have greatly influenced soil development and consequently the variety of plants and animals that it supports.
