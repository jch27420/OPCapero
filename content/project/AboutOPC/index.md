&nbsp; &nbsp; <span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) lies nestled between the city of Windsor and the town of LaSalle in Southern Ontario, Canada. This ~350 hectare (ha) complex was once home to the town of Ojibway, which was annexed by the city of Windsor in 1966. Moreover, as the name suggests, it is part of the traditional territory of the Anishnaabeg people (i.e. **Three Fires Confederacy** of Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa) **<sup>1,2</sup>**.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; As shown in the map above <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is composed of five distinct areas: (i) **Ojibway Park** (~61.5 ha); (ii) **Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve** (105 ha); (iii) **Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** (~15.6 ha); (iv) **Spring Garden ANSI** (~117 ha); and (v) **Black Oak Heritage Park** (~50.6 ha). Collectively they are home to more than 160 species of provincially rare plants and animals, more than any other site in Ontario **<sup>1</sup>**. Today, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> represents one of the last major remnants of **[Tallgrass Communities](https://tallgrassontario.org/wp-site/)** (<span id="Gr2">TGC</span>) left within the province **<sup>3,4,5</sup>**. It is estimated that southern Ontario was home to between 1,100 and 2,000 km&#178; of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> **<sup>2,4,6,7</sup>**. Needless to say, what little remains of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> within the province is certainly in need of our protection **<sup>8</sup>**.  

**1. HISTORY OF GRASSLANDS IN NORTH AMERICA AND SOUTHERN ONTARIO**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Prior to European settlement **prairies** (French: for *meadow*) and **savannas** (Spanish: *sabana*) covered much of North America's heartland, stretching from the northern plains of Canada's prairie provinces to south and central Texas. Looking eastward, these vast grasslands extended from the dry foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the large stands of deciduous forest just east of the mighty Mississippi river. A notable feature of this great grass plain was the <u>triangular shape</u> of its eastern border, often referred to as the <span id="Dpurp">Prairie Peninsula</span>. This neck-like extension of the mid-western prairie covers most of Iowa and northern Missouri, large parts of neighbouring Illinois and portions of northwestern Indiana. However, just east of this peninsula can be found patches of **prairie** and **savanna** habitat, particularly in southern Michigan, north-western Ohio and southern Ontario.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; The shorelines of the southern Great Lakes, including those of mighty Lake St. Clair, were home to relatively large tracts of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span>. In fact, the western end of Lake Erie is thought to have supported some 80,000 ha of wet prairie, stretching from Sandusky Bay Ohio to Detroit Michigan. On the Canadian side, historical records show that there were extensive prairies and open woodlands bordering the north shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, as well as the eastern and southern shores of Lake St. Clair and Lake Huron, respectively. Moreover, large pockets of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> were also found further inland in close proximity to waterways (i.e. Thames and Grand Rivers), wetlands (i.e. Point Pelee, Rondeau, Long Point, St. Clair delta) and some inland lakes, particularly the southern shore of **Rice Lake** in Northumberland county. The rich grasslands along Lake St. Clair and the surrounding region, notably greater Essex and and parts of Kent county, were quite extensive according to some of the earliest explorers of this region. The Flemish friar Louis Hennepin wrote during his travels of the Windsor region (1679) "...*the country between those two Lakes [Erie and Lake St. Clair] is very well situated, and the soil fertile. The banks of the streight [Detroit River] are vast meadows, and the prospect is terminated with some hills covered with vineyards*..." **<sup>10</sup>**. An even more glowing description of the region courtesy of Antoine de Lamothe-Cadillac (1701), founder of Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit, stated "...*Detroit is, probably, only a canal or a river of moderate breadth ...through which the sparkling and pellucid waters of Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron (which are so many seas of sweet water) flow and glide away gently and with a moderate current into Lake Erie, into the Ontario or Frontenac, and go at last to mingle in the river St. Lawrence with those of the ocean. The banks are so many vast meadows where the freshness of these beautiful streams keep the grass always green. These same meadows are fringed with long and broad avenues of fruit trees which have never felt the careful hand of the watchful gardener*..." **<sup>9</sup>**

military engineer Joseph-Gaspard Chaussegros de L&eacute;ry's report on his journey to Detroit (1749) "...*the lands on the east side of the river are bordered by prairies in such a way that the inhabitants have no wood to cut in order to clear their fields and sow their grain. It is only necessary to plough the land and to cut down some shrubs*..." **<sup>9</sup>**

Today, we are also reminded of the region's past grasslands by the names of some local communitiesl, such as Prairie Siding (a village just west of Chatham along the Thames River).

In fact, many of southern Ontario's early explorers and surveyors reported seeing vast grassy plains and meadows that extended for miles in several directions.  Among them was Robert Stevenson (1843) who aptly remarked ‟...the land on the banks [Thames River] is about the richest I ever saw in any country...extensive grass plains stretching for miles into the country, without tree save here and there a small clump like an island in the plain” (Guillet, 1963).
	Based on these and other historical accounts, southwestern Ontario alone is believed to have housed >50,000 ha. (500 km2) of mixed prairie-savanna habitat, while Rice Lake just south of Peterborough supported somewhere between 17,200 and 30,000 ha. (172 - 300 km2) of prairie community [P.M. Catling, 1992 #19]. 


Even the rosy estimate of ~800 km2 may be woefully conservative, as some ecologists have suggested that perhaps 1,000 to 2,000 km2 of southern Ontario was covered by a mix of prairie and savanna communities [Rodger, 1998 #20].  Regardless of the exact size of the original prairie-savanna communities in southern Ontario, the region's once rich and varied ecology likely runs contrary to what most of us have been taught in school.  No doubt our textbooks and teachers lead us to believe that our earliest ancestors converted thick stands of timber into farms and small settlements.  Nevertheless, much of this once vital and diverse habitat has been lost to agriculture, urbanization, pollution and improper land management.  Today, less than 2% of the roughly 80 to 90 million hectares of original North American prairie and savanna remain.  This dire situation also exists in the province of Ontario, where likely only 1 to 2% of the original prairie-savanna habitat persists today. 

Although oak savannas and tallgrass prairies are distinct and rare ecosystems today, they were once found in abundance and in close proximity with one another across large parts of North America.  Part of the reason for their proximity is that savannas are by their very nature transitional communities, or ecotones, that link largely treeless mid-western prairies with the eastern deciduous forests.  This dynamic progression in vegetation communities is predominately shaped by climate.  The dry conditions that dominate the Great Plains of the western interior are a result of a rain shadow cast by the equally great Rocky Mountains.  This natural barrier to the prevailing westerly winds forces the Pacific’s humid Maritime Polar (mP) air mass to ascend the mountains.  At these higher and colder altitudes excess water vapour precipitates, in essence ‛milking’ the eastbound mP air mass of its moisture.  As this ‛milked’ Pacific air descends the leeward side of the mountains it creates arid conditions, one that short and mixed grasses thrive in and come to dominate as the climax plant species.  As one moves eastward across the Great Plains the influence of the Rocky Mountains’ rain shadow diminishes and soil conditions improve (i.e. depth, moisture, nitrogen levels).  Under these more favourable conditions both herbaceous (i.e. non-woody) and woody (i.e. trees) plants flourish.  Again, climate is the major player here, particular the amount of precipitation and evaporation that occurs in the mid-western region.  Here climatic conditions still favour prairie type vegetation, but the increased depth of the soil and its higher moisture levels allow tall grasses to dominate and some hardy species of trees, like oaks, to take root.

The change in vegetation in this mid-western region is again largely a product of climate.  The main climatic players here are opposing air masses, namely the cold continental Arctic (cA) air mass out of the north and the warm Maritime Tropical (mT) air mass out of the south (Fig. X).  These two air masses clash with one another throughout the year over most of the continent, creating weather fronts that we have come to either love or hate on our off week days.  Meanwhile, the eastbound mP air mass, or westerly winds, is wedged between these two converging air masses and together they create a precipitation and evaporation regime that perhaps best explains the existence of the ‛Prairie Peninsula’.  This term was coined by Transeau (1935), who clearly recognized the usefulness of the iso-climatic lines of precipitation-evaporation ratios with regards to mapping the extent of prairie across the continent’s interior.   

The climatic conditions that allowed tallgrass prairies and oak savnnas to bless the shores of southern Ontario dates back roughly 9,000 to 5,000 years ago, a period of time that paleoclimatologists generally refer to as the Hypsithermal or Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM).  This is when the northern hemisphere experienced slightly warmer temperatures, due to cyclic changes in earth's orbit, specifically its obliquity (axle tilt), which directly influences the amount of incident solar radiation (i.e. insolation) hitting the earth (for more details see: section 2.2.1).  Local variations in the exact timing of the HTM were likely influenced by the proximity of the receding but substantial volumes of ice 9,000 years ago.  For example, reconstruction of the post-glacial vegetation regime using pollen and fossil records of a former Oak savanna in southern Ontario show clear transitions in vegetation types over the past 12,000 years [J. M. Szeicz, 1991 #32].  This study showed that the site was once dominated by open Pine woodlands, initially Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana) between 10,000 and 9,000 ya followed by White Pine (Pinus strobus) between 10,000 and ~6,000 ya.  However, some time between 8,000 and 6,000 ya the open P. stobus forest gave way to Oak savanna, a situation that lasted until ~1850 A.D. when Europeans systematically cleared the land for farming [J. M. Szeicz, 1991 #32].  

These changes in geography, climate and soil geology (*see: section 2.1) are not the only factors that have played an important role in maintaining prairie-savanna communities.  Grazing and fire have also had a hand in shaping these now endangered habitats.  Herds of bison that once numbered in the 10s of millions before being hunted to near extinction, cropped large swaths of grassland as they migrated across it, including parts of southern Ontario (Campbell 1997).  The grazing activities of these and other prairie herbivores actually stimulated the growth of plants, particularly the dominant grasses (family Poaceae) that have evolved, hand-in-hand, with the feeding habits of these grazers.  Grasses are one of the hardiest plants on the planet, capable of thriving in the face of severe disturbances (i.e. fire, draught, grazing, flooding) because of their phenomenal regenerative capacity.  The grasses vegetative (i.e. asexual) growth, which takes place in defined structures located at or near the soil surface (i.e. basal meristems), allows them to quickly sprout in response to various types of disturbances.  Many grasses are also capable of reproducing asexually via horizontal stem structures located above (i.e. stolons) and below (i.e. rhizomes; Greek: ῥίζωμα = rootstalk) the ground.  As the grasses grows upward and mature, a new type of growth centre develops at the top of the plant (i.e. apical meristem), which will eventually produce seeds via sexual (not asexual) reproduction.  So grazing, which removes the tender and most desirable tops of the plant (i.e. new growth), including the apical meristems, actually stimulates new growth from the more mature vegetative meristems located at base of the plant.


As mentioned above, prairie plants, particularly grasses are superbly adapted to tough environmental conditions, including seasonal fluctuations in groundwater levels, limiting nutrient levels (i.e. low nitrogen), grazing and other physical disturbances, most notably fire.  In fact, fire is considered a key natural regenerative mechanism in prairie-savanna communities.  Prairie plants and many types of savanna oaks are draught and fire resistant, owing in large part to their deep and extensive underground root system.  Disturbance regimens, particularly intermediate levels of disturbances, such as annual spring fires in the case of prairies and savannas, or forest openings created by occasional wind-storms, often stimulates biodiversity and increases the productivity of ecosystems.  For many of the most dominant tallgrass prairie species, the ability to grow back year after year largely depends on fire, since it: (i) eliminates invasive, fire-intolerant, non-native prairie species, (ii) removes any dead, slowly decomposing plant matter, (iii) warms the ground directly and indirectly by lowering the lands albedo (i.e. amount of reflected sunlight, which is decreased by the ash and blackened earth), and (iv)  keeps the land open and restricts the amount of available nitrogen, conditions that are advantageous for sun-loving prairie plants [Tilman, 1992 #14][Tilman, 1996 #13].  Large open wind swept plains with plenty of dead litter from the previous growing season is ideal fodder for spring fires, a product of both lightening strikes and historical land management practices by aboriginal people.  Unfortunately, the suppression of fire over the past two centuries by European settlers has contributed greatly to the wide spread loss of prairie and savanna habitat.  

The lightly treed savannas and open woodlands, mostly dominated by fire resistant Bur (Quercus macrocarpa), White (Q. alba) and other Oak species, were natural transitional communities, or ecotones, that linked the largely treeless prairies with the deciduous forest biome to the east.  The term biome refers to a rather large geographical area that shares similar vegetation and climatic conditions.  Moreover, these two neighbouring ecosystems are actually considered part of the greater grassland biome, and together with the other great biomes of the world make up one global web of life, or biosphere.  This continuity among living communities from one pole to the other may help to explain some of the problems with imposing rigid, albeit ecological relevant borders, particularly when even a relatively modest sized nature preserve, such as OPC, can hold so much natural variety, from low-lying wetlands and lagoons to wet and dry prairies, open oak savannas, and dense Carolinian forests.  Even scientists argue over how best to define these unique biological communities.  For example, under the most basic scientific scheme there are at least three different types of prairies based on the dominant type of grass species found within its borders.  Short-grass prairies, which generally occupy the dry, western most portions of the grassland biome, naturally cover uplands or hilly regions whose well drained soils typically supports Side-oats Gamma grass (Bouteloua curtipendula), as well as forbs (i.e. herbaceous flowering plants) such as Purple Prairie-clover (Dalea purpurea) and Cylindric Blazing-star (Liatris cylindracea).  Mixed-grass prairies, which mark the transition from dry to wetter climes, have deeper soils with higher moisture levels that can support Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans, Fig. X) and forbs such as Rough Blazing-star (Liatris aspera, Fig. X), and Round-headed Bush-clover (Lespedeza capitata, Fig. X).  Lastly, tall-grass prairies, which inhabit the eastern most parts of the grassland, are blessed with plenty of rainfall, deep soils and a wide variety of plant species.  Some of the more common grass species found here include Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardi, Fig. X) and Cordgrass (Spartina pectinata, Fig. X), and numerous forbs such as Dense Blazing-star (Liatris spicata, Fig. X), Culver's-root (Veronicastrum virginicum, Fig. X), New England Aster (Aster novae-angliae, Fig. X) and Butterfly Milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa, Fig X).
	Nevertheless, ecologists and conservationists alike use terms such as biome, tallgrass prairie or savanna to better define, catalogue, understand and ultimately protect these rare biological communities.  Given that the border separating these terrestrial ecosystems are often blurred, even the simplest prairie classification schemes may be inadequate to achieve these goals.  Thus, ecologists are using finer scaled descriptors to better understand these dynamic living systems.  This seems appropriate considering that even the small but functioning tracts of tallgrass prairie, such as the one found at OPC, is actually a mosaic of seasonally wet and dry sandy plains and depressions, marshes, oak savannas and more densely wooded areas.  As a result, even these tallgrass prairie communities and their associated savannas have another recognized level of classification, primarily based on differences in soil moisture, terrain and species affiliations.  Wet tall-grass prairies are noted for their saturated soils include wet, mesic, dry-mesic, dry and sandy tallgrass prairie types.  key defining terms that generate a finer 


**2. ECOLOGY AND GEOLOGY OF OPC**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Ontario's ecological land classification systems <span id="Dred">OPC</span> makes up part of the western most boundary of the **Essex Ecodistrict** (**7E-1**) **<sup>9,10</sup>**. The ecoregion's characteristic flat terrain is largely due to the actions of glacial ice and meltwater between 75,000-to-10,000 years ago (i.e. late [Wisconsin glacial period](https://opentextbc.ca/geology/chapter/16-1-glacial-periods-in-earths-history/)). One of the most notable geological features that was generated during this time is the extensive layers of sandy and clay-like material that <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is situated on (i.e. **St. Clair Clay Plain**). This glacial debris has greatly influenced soil development at <span id="Dred">OPC</span> and consequently the variety of plants and animals that it can support.
