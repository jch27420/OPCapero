&nbsp; &nbsp; As shown in the map above <span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) is composed of five distinct areas: (i) **Ojibway Park** (~61.5 ha); (ii) **Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve** (105 ha); (iii) **Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** (~15.6 ha); (iv) **Spring Garden ANSI** (~117 ha); and (v) **Black Oak Heritage Park** (~50.6 ha). Collectively these areas are home to at least 160 rare plant and animal species within Ontario, which is more than any other site in the province.**<sup>1,2</sup>** Today, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> represents one of the last major remnants of **[Tallgrass Communities](https://tallgrassontario.org/wp-site/)** (<span id="Gr2">TGC</span>) within the province. It therefore comes as no surprise that where ever this rare ecosystem exists it most certainly need our protection.**<sup>3-8</sup>**  

**1. HISTORY OF PRAIRIES IN ONTARIO**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Prior to European settlement **prairies** covered much of North America's heartland, stretching from the northern plains of Canada's prairie provinces to south and central Texas. Looking eastward, these grasslands extended from the dry foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the large stands of deciduous forest just east of the mighty Mississippi river. A notable feature of this great grassy plain was the *triangular* shape of its eastern border, often referred to as the <span id="Dpurp">Prairie Peninsula</span>.**<sup>9</sup>** This neck-like extension of mid-western prairie once covered most of Iowa and northern Missouri, large parts of neighbouring Illinois (known as the Prairie State), as well as portions of Indiana and Ohio. In addition, substantial patches of **prairie** and **oak savanna** could be found amongst the eastern forests and wetlands just beyond the peninsula's formal borders. A good example of this would be the western end of the Lake Erie. Many eye witness accounts from the early 1800s tell of a large lake plain with extensive swamp forests, oak woodlands and wet prairies.**<sup>10</sup>** As the famed naturalist Harold Mayfield once stated:  

>"...*Few people today realize the original extent of wet grasslands in this region. One continuous strip extended almost without a break from Sandusky Bay around the southwest corner of Lake Erie and up the western shore almost to Detroit. An early observer estimated the area of this tract at more than 200,000 acres* [>800 km&#178;]."**<sup>10</sup>**  

In southern Ontario many early explorers and surveyors also discovered large tracts of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> bordering the Great Lakes (i.e. Erie, Ontario, Huron) as well as other inland waterways (i.e. Lakes St. Clair and Rice; Detroit, St. Clair, Thames and Grand rivers). For example, the famous Flemish friar Louis Hennepin (1679) described the banks of the Detroit river as:  

>"...*the country between those two Lakes* [Erie and Lake St. Clair] *is very well situated, and the soil fertile. The banks of the streight* [Detroit River] *are vast meadows, and the prospect is terminated with some hills covered with vineyards*."**<sup>11</sup>**  

Antoine de Lamothe-Cadillac (1701), founder of Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit, also had a favourable view of the Detroit river:  

>"...*Detroit is, probably, only a canal or a river of moderate breadth ...through which the sparkling and pellucid waters of Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron (which are so many seas of sweet water) flow and glide away gently and with a moderate current into Lake Erie, into the Ontario or Frontenac, and go at last to mingle in the river St. Lawrence with those of the ocean. The banks are so many vast meadows where the freshness of these beautiful streams keep the grass always green*."**<sup>12</sup>**  

Even today the names of some settlements remind us of southern Ontario's past grassland glory (e.g. Prairie Siding - just west of Chatham; Plainville - just south of Rice Lake).  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altogether, it is estimated that between 800 and 2,000 km&#178; of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> once covered parts of southern Ontario's landscape.**<sup>2-5</sup>** Regardless of "*true*" extent of these original grassland communities the rapid lost of these habitats to urban and agricultural developments some two centuries ago seems to have also erased our collective memory of them. For you would be hard pressed to find anyone who knows that these rare ecosystems even exist today. Arguably there is no other major ecosystem in North America, not even the old-growth rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, that have been so fully altered by humans. All toll it is estimated that <2% of North America's original tallgrass prairie remains today.**<sup>3,4</sup>** Unfortunately, the situation is far worse for **oak savannas**. These "*parkland*"-like areas, that once covered an estimated 12,000,000 ha of the north-central United States alone, are now almost all gone (i.e. ~0.1% remains).**<sup>13</sup>**  

**2. ECOLOGY OF TALLGRASS COMMUNITIES AT OPC**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; The term "*Tallgrass Communities*" (<span id="Gr2">TGC</span>) refers to the types of plants and animals found in these ecosystems (i.e. unique mix of tallgrass prairie and oak savanna). These rare habitats of eastern North America are home to hundreds of herbaceous plant species (i.e. grasses, sedges, forbs). And as the name suggests they are dominated by tall grasses such as **Big bluestem** (*Andropogon gerardi*), **Prairie Cordgrass** (*Sporobolus michauxianus*) and **Little bluestem** (*Schizachyrium scoparium*). Many smaller **sedges**, another <u>grass-like</u> plant, as well as hundreds of flowering plant (**forbs**) species can also be found in <span id="Gr2">TGC</span>. For example, the beautiful yellow **Tall Coreopsis** (*Coreopsis tripteris*), showy pink **Canadian tick-trefoil** (*Desmodium canadense*) and dazzling magenta spike of the **Dense Blazing star** (*Liatris spicata*) are all commonly found at <span id="Dred">OPC</span> during the peak summer months. This abundance of **forbs** also provides food for a variety of pollinating insects, including many that require a specific plant species to complete their life cycle (e.g. Monarch butterfly and Milkweeds). The **savanna** component of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> refers to "*parkland-like*" areas (i.e. varying tree canopy cover, usually 10-to-35%) that are dominated by both woody and herbaceous plants. The dominant woody species of <span id="Dred">OPC</span>'s savannas are **Pin oak** (*Q. palustris*) and **Black oak** (*Q. velutina*), but others such as **Bur oak** (*Q. macrocarpa*) and **White oak** (*Q. alba*) also reside here. The herbaceous plants of these savannas are predominately prairie species, but some forbs are **savanna** specialists. For example, the beautiful but hemi-parasitic **[Smooth Yellow False Foxglove](https://www.ontario.ca/page/smooth-yellow-false-foxglove)** (*Aureolaria flava*) harvests some water and nutrients from the roots of neighbouring **oak** trees.**<sup>14</sup>** Although *A. flava* is capable of photosynthesis these parasitized resources presumably helps the plant survive some of the harsher conditions (e.g. occasional droughts, nutrient poor sandy soils) that are common to these regions.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; The *transitional* nature of **oak savannas** is what ecologists call an <span id="Dpurp">ecotone</span>. Conceptually these areas represent transitions (either sharp or more gradual) between adjacent but distinct ecological communities (e.g. open prairie and closed canopy forest).**<sup>15</sup>** For example, some of <span id="Dred">OPC</span>'s **oak savannas** connect open prairie to more heavily wooded areas, while other more isolated oaks look like small "*islands*" amid a sea of tall grasses and flowers. Needless to say, these types of transitional communities are complex owing to their varying sizes, shapes (e.g. "*patch-work*" geometry), and the ways they can interact with neighbouring ecosystems (i.e. flow of resources).**<sup>15-18</sup>** Perhaps the most important reason for studying and protecting <span id="Dpurp">ecotones</span>, like **oak savannas**, is because of the reported positive effects they have on species abundance and richness.**<sup>19-21</sup>** Certainly, from my own experiences at <span id="Dred">OPC</span>, the **oak savannas** do attract certain bird species, like the **[Red-headed Woodpecker](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-headed_Woodpecker/overview)** (*Melanerpes erythrocephalus*) and **[Indigo Bunting](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Indigo_Bunting/overview)** (*Passerina cyanea*). Although my sightings of *M. erythrocephalus* have often been fleeting, my regular encounters with *P. cyanea* during the summer months have been anything but brief. These brilliantly colored songbirds are quite vocal when feeding on insects along the borders of the oak stands and as a consequence fairly easy to spot.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; So what factors control the geographic distribution of tallgrass prairies and oak savannas in North America? Although <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> are dynamic systems, like any other natural community, they are greatly influenced by <span id="Blue">climate</span> and natural disturbances (i.e. <span id="Red">wild fires</span> and <span id="Purple">grazing</span>).**<sup>22</sup>**

**1.** <span id="Blue">CLIMATE</span>: The geographical distribution of large plant communities (i.e. **biomes**) like grasslands are controlled in large part by climate. **Edgar Transeau**, a pioneering ecologists who coined the term <span id="Dpurp">Prairie Peninsula</span>, actually mapped the geographic boundary of this '*peninsula*' based on the climatic characteristics of the region (i.e. ratio of rainfall to evaporation).<sup>**9,23**</sup> In Ontario climate, specifically its recent glacial history, has played a major role in shaping the development of its vegetation. The province, as well as the rest of Canada, has been subjected to multiple **Ice Ages** since the latter part of the **[Pleistocene epoch](https://stratigraphy.org/chart)**.**<sup>24</sup>** The last of these glaciation events, known as the **Wisconsin**, peaked at around 20,000 years ago (**ya**). Following this glacial maximum the climate quickly warmed resulting in the northerly retreat of the **Laurentide Ice Sheet** (<span id="Purple">LIS</span>). The time-line of these past glaciation events has been reconstructed using isotopic chemistry techniques applied to samples taken from glacial ice and ocean bottom (benthic) sediments. The **[three stable isotopes](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat3/)** of <span id="Red">O</span>xygen (<sup>16</sup><span id="Red">O</span> = 99.757%, <sup>17</sup><span id="Red">O</span> = 0.038%, and <sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span> = 0.205%)**<sup>25</sup>** are of particular interest since they are the building blocks of water (<span id="Blue">H</span><sub>2</sub><span id="Red">O</span>) and biogenic carbonates (e.g. fossil **Foraminifera** shells).**<sup>26</sup>** Although all three of the oxygen isotopes have the same number of protons and electrons (i.e. same chemical behaviour), they do have varying numbers of neutrons and therefore different masses (e.g. <sup>16</sup><span id="Red">O</span> = 16 atomic mass units). It is this difference in mass that gives isotopes slightly different physical-chemical properties. As geologist **Eelco J. Rohling** clearly states:

>"...*Molecules vibrate with a fundamental frequency which depends on the mass of the isotopes...the resultant differences...imply that bonds formed by light isotopes are weaker than those formed by heavy isotopes. Hence, as a rule of thumb, molecules comprised of the light isotopes react somewhat more easily than those comprised of the heavy isotopes*."**<sup>26</sup>**  

This difference in bond strength results in the '*fractionation*' of **isotopologes** (i.e. molecules that differ only in their isotopic composition) between any two substances (e.g. <span id="Blue">H</span><sub>2</sub><span id="Red">O</span> &ndash; <span id="Ly">Ca</span>**C**<span id="Red">O</span><sub>3</sub> system) or two phases of the same substance (e.g. liquid &#8644; vapour phases). **<sup>26</sup>** For example, the heavier <span id="Blue">H</span><sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span> tends to evaporate more slowly and condense more quickly than <span id="Blue">H</span><sub>2</sub><sup>16</sup><span id="Red">O</span>. More importantly, the fractionation of these two water **isotopologes** is <u>temperature dependent</u>.  

>"...*measuring the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of fossil foraminiferal calcite has been one of the most effective techniques for reconstructing ocean and climate conditions of past times*."**<sup>26</sup>**

Since the fractionation between calcite (<span id="Ly">Ca</span>**C**<span id="Red">O</span><sub>3</sub>) and water is a function of temperature, than one can use the ratio of oxygen isotopes (&delta;<sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span>) from fossil **Foraminiferal** shells to estimate the temperature of the seawater these single celled organisms once inhabited. The method for calculating &delta;<sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span> (seen below) is relatively straight forward. In fact, it hasn't changed since **Harold Urey**, the Nobel prize winning chemist who invented these oxygen isotopic methods, first introduced it back in the early 1950s.**<sup>27-31</sup>**  

<!-- Delta-18-oxygen calculation -->

where <strong>R</strong> = <sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span>/<sup>16</sup><span id="Red">O</span>

</div>

The use of &delta;<sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span>, as well as other types of **[paleoclimate proxies](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/climate-research-and-development-program/science/paleoclimate-proxies)** (e.g. pollen and spores), has been particularly useful in determining the types of plant communities (i.e. **biomes**) that once populated North America since end of the last ice age ~11,700 **ya** (Note: designated end of the **[Pleistocene epoch](https://stratigraphy.org/chart)**). Studies of pollen from across the province show relatively rapid changes in vegetation during the early part of the **Holocene**.**<sup>32-36</sup>** Deglaciated areas that once supported **Spruce** (*Picea spp.*) and tundra-like (herbs and shrubs) vegetation gave way to **Jack Pine** (*Pinus banksiana*), **Paper Birch** (*Betula papyrifera*) and a minor mix of other species (e.g. **Oaks**, **Ashes**, **Elms**, **Beech**). By ~10,000 **ya** a wide band of forests had developed along the trailing edge of the retreating ice sheet that stretched from eastern Alberta and southern Saskatchewan down through the mid-west and north-eastern United States.**<sup>36</sup>**
However, by the **mid-Holocene** (~9,000 to 6,000 **ya**) the climate in North America became unusual warm and dry during the summer months.**<sup>36-38</sup>** This so-called <span id="Blue">H</span>olocene <span id="Blue">C</span>limate <span id="Blue">O</span>ptimum (<span id="Blue">HCO</span>) is thought to have been the major cause of the eastward expansion of the western prairie and the subsequent development of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> within southern Ontario. Cyclic changes in the earth's orbit (i.e. **[Milankovitch cycles](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/)**) appears to be the main cause of the **mid-Holocene** warming event, a process referred to as **orbital forcing**.**<sup>39-42</sup>** However, it is interesting to note that the timing of the <span id="Blue">HCO</span> varied across the north. A review of **Holocene** proxy data from across the western Arctic (140 sites) revealed that in Alaska and northwest Canada warming started earlier at around 11,000 **ya** (lasting ~2,200 years), while in the Hudson Bay region and the Canadian Arctic islands warming started ~7,300 **ya** (lasting ~3,100 years) and ~8,600 **ya** (lasting ~3,400 years), respectively.**<sup>43</sup>** Clearly regional factors played a role in modifying the timing of the <span id="Blue">HCO</span> (e.g. ocean currents, albedo and temperature affects of large remnant ice sheets around Hudson Bay). Nevertheless, by ~7,000 **ya** Ontario (now ice free) had undergone noticeable changes in the composition of its forests. Pollen studies shows that both cool mixed forests (e.g. **Birch**, **Beech**, **White Pine**, **Hemlock**, **Cedar**) as well as the more southerly deciduous forests (e.g. **Sugar Maple**, **Ash**, **Oaks**, **Beech**, **Hickory**, **Chestnut**) had advanced further north beyond their current ranges.**<sup>32-36</sup>** The relatively stable levels of herbaceous plant pollen (i.e. grasses and forbs) during this time also suggests that open forested areas, like oak savannas, were part of the province's landscape. By the end of the <span id="Blue">HCO</span> (~4,000 **ya** to present) the climate in Ontario (and the rest of the continent) became cooler and wetter resulting in the southerly retreat of both the cool-mixed and temperate deciduous forests.**<sup>32-36</sup>** This wetter climate likely allowed forests to invade open areas leading to a mosaic of vegetation types within the province.  

**2. NATURAL DISTURBANCES:** <span id="Purple">GRAZING</span> **and** <span id="Red">FIRE</span>: Grasslands around the world are known for their periodic droughts, frequent <span id="Red">fires</span> and large numbers of <span id="Purple">grazing</span> (and burrowing) animals they support.**<sup>22</sup>** These abiotic and biotic factors often interact with one another to significantly alter the structure (e.g. species composition) of grasslands. For example, studies have shown that spring burning of eastern tallgrass prairies can stimulate the growth of some plant species, notably dominant grasses (e.g. **Big Bluestem**, *Andropogon gerardii*), while inhibiting the growth of others (i.e. forbs).**<sup>44,45</sup>** However, when <span id="Red">fire</span> is combined with <span id="Purple">grazing</span> then both tallgrasses and forbs do well (i.e. increase species diversity and richness).**<sup>44,45</sup>** Many prairie plants, like *A. gerardii*, are specifically adapted to tolerate <span id="Red">fire</span> owing to their underground vegetative growth centers (i.e. **rhizomes**). <span id="Red">Fire</span> not only clears the ground of dead decaying plant material, but also eliminates invasive <span id="Red">fire</span>-intolerant plant species (e.g. invasive shrubs and trees). In this way burning not only keeps the land open for sun-loving prairie plants, but also limits the levels of nitrogen (from detrital biomass) in the soil. If the latter is left unchecked it can negatively impact prairie plant diversity and function (i.e. carbon storage).**<sup>46,47</sup>** The positive interactions between <span id="Red">fire</span> and <span id="Purple">grazing</span> may be due to the ruminant's preference for grasses over other less palatable plant species. After all, the diet of **[Bison](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/how-bison-help-shape-the-northern-great-plains)** (*Bison bison*), a '*true*' **keystone herbivore** of the prairies, is almost exclusively grasses.**<sup>22,48,49</sup>** Consumption of the tallgrass would therefore prevent the formation of a thick grass canopy that would otherwise block sunlight access to the smaller forbs. However, do these same relationships hold regardless of the size or composition of the grassland? It's not hard to imagine how spatial and temporal changes in the intensity of multiple disturbance regimes (e.g. <span id="Red">fire</span>, <span id="Purple">grazing</span>, **drought**, **invasive species**, etc.) could help create a healthy patch-work of species rich habitats. Nevertheless, determining how this complex network of interactions affect biodiversity, particularly the key role it plays in ecosystem stability and productivity (e.g. ecosystem goods and services), will no doubt be invaluable given our current climate change dilemma.**<sup>50-54</sup>**
