Collectively these areas are home to at least 160 rare plant and animal species within Ontario, which is more than any other site in the province.**<sup>1,2</sup>** Today, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> represents one of the last major remnants of **[Tallgrass Communities](https://tallgrassontario.org/wp-site/)** (<span id="Gr2">TGC</span>) remaining in the province that is certainly in need of our protection.**<sup>3-8</sup>**

**1. HISTORY OF PRAIRIES IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Prior to European settlement **prairies** covered much of North America's heartland, stretching from the northern plains of Canada's prairie provinces to south and central Texas. Looking eastward, these grasslands extended from the dry foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the large stands of deciduous forest just east of the mighty Mississippi river. A notable feature of this great grassy plain was the *triangular* shape of its eastern border, often referred to as the <span id="Dpurp">Prairie Peninsula</span>.**<sup>9</sup>** This neck-like extension of mid-western prairie once covered most of Iowa and northern Missouri, large parts of neighbouring Illinois (known as the Prairie State), as well as portions of Indiana and Ohio. In addition, substantial patches of **prairie** and **oak savanna** could be found amongst the eastern forests and wetlands just beyond the peninsula's formal borders. A good example of this would be the western end of the Lake Erie. Many eye witness accounts from the early 1800s tell of a large lake plain with extensive swamp forests, oak woodlands and wet prairies.**<sup>10</sup>** As the famed naturalist Harold Mayfield once stated:  

>"...*Few people today realize the original extent of wet grasslands in this region. One continuous strip extended almost without a break from Sandusky Bay around the southwest corner of Lake Erie and up the western shore almost to Detroit. An early observer estimated the area of this tract at more than 200,000 acres* [>800 km&#178;]."**<sup>10</sup>**  

In southern Ontario many early explorers and surveyors also discovered large tracts of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> bordering the Great Lakes (i.e. Erie, Ontario, Huron) as well as other inland waterways (i.e. Lakes St. Clair and Rice; Detroit, St. Clair, Thames and Grand rivers). For example, the famous Flemish friar Louis Hennepin (1679) described the banks of the Detroit river as:  
>"...*the country between those two Lakes* [Erie and Lake St. Clair] *is very well situated, and the soil fertile. The banks of the streight* [Detroit River] *are vast meadows, and the prospect is terminated with some hills covered with vineyards*."**<sup>11</sup>**  

Antoine de Lamothe-Cadillac (1701), founder of Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit, also had a favourable view of the Detroit river:  

>"...*Detroit is, probably, only a canal or a river of moderate breadth ...through which the sparkling and pellucid waters of Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron (which are so many seas of sweet water) flow and glide away gently and with a moderate current into Lake Erie, into the Ontario or Frontenac, and go at last to mingle in the river St. Lawrence with those of the ocean. The banks are so many vast meadows where the freshness of these beautiful streams keep the grass always green*."**<sup>12</sup>**  

Even today the names of some settlements remind us of the southern Ontario's past grassland glory (e.g. Prairie Siding - just west of Chatham; Plainville - just south of Rice Lake).  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altogether, it is estimated that between 800 and 2,000 km&#178; of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> once covered parts of southern Ontario's landscape.**<sup>2-5</sup>** Regardless of "*true*" extent of these original grassland communities the rapid lost of these habitats to urban and agricultural developments some two centuries ago seems to have also erased our collective memory of them. For you would be hard pressed to find anyone who knows that these rare ecosystems even exist today. All toll less than 2% of North America's original tallgrass prairie remains today.**<sup>3,4</sup>** Unfortunately, the situation is far worse for **oak savannas**. These "*parkland*"-like areas, that once covered an estimated 12,000,000 ha of the north-central United States alone, are now almost all gone (i.e. ~0.1% remains).**<sup>13</sup>**  

**2. ECOLOGY OF TALLGRASS COMMUNITIES AT OPC**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; The term "tallgrass communities" refers to the types of plants and animals found in these ecosystems (i.e. unique mix of tallgrass prairie and oak savanna). These rare habitats of eastern North America are home to hundreds of herbaceous plant species (i.e. grasses, sedges, forbs). As the name suggests these ecosystems are dominated by tall grasses such as **Big bluestem** (*Andropogon gerardi*), **Prairie Cordgrass** (*Sporobolus michauxianus*) and **Little bluestem** (*Schizachyrium scoparium*). Many smaller **sedges**, another <u>grass-like</u> plant, as well as hundreds of flowering plant (**forbs**) species can also be found in these regions. For example, the beautiful yellow **Tall Coreopsis** (*Coreopsis tripteris*), showy pink **Canadian tick-trefoil** (*Desmodium canadense*) and dazzling magenta spike of the **Dense Blazing star** (*Liatris spicata*) are all commonly found at <span id="Dred">OPC</span> during the peak summer months. The abundance of flowering plants in these natural habitats also provides food for a variety of pollinating insects, including many that require a specific plant species to complete their life cycle (e.g. Monarch butterfly and Milkweeds). The **savanna** component of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> refers to "*parkland-like*" areas (i.e. varying tree canopy cover, usually 10-to-35%) that are dominated by both woody and herbaceous plants. The dominant woody species of <span id="Dred">OPC</span>'s savannas are **Pin oak** (*Q. palustris*) and **Black oak** (*Q. velutina*), but others such as **Bur oak** (*Q. macrocarpa*) and **White oak** (*Q. alba*) also reside here. The herbaceous plants of these savannas are predominately prairie species, but some forbs are **savanna** specialists. For example, the beautiful but hemi-parasitic **[Smooth Yellow False Foxglove](https://www.ontario.ca/page/smooth-yellow-false-foxglove)** (*Aureolaria flava*) harvests some water and nutrients from the roots of neighbouring **oak** trees.**<sup>14</sup>** Although *A. flava* is capable of photosynthesis these parasitized resources presumably helps the plant survive some of the region's harsh conditions (e.g. occasional droughts, nutrient poor sandy soils).  
&nbsp; &nbsp; The *transitional* nature of **oak savannas** is what ecologists call an <span id="Dpurp">ecotone</span>. Conceptually these areas represent transitions (either sharp or more gradual) between adjacent but distinct ecological communities (e.g. open prairie and closed canopy forest).**<sup>15</sup>** For example, some of <span id="Dred">OPC</span>'s **oak savannas** connect open prairie to more heavily wooded areas, while other isolated stands of oaks look like "*islands*" amid a sea of tall grasses and flowers. Needless to say, these types of transitional communities are complex owing to their varying sizes and shapes (e.g. "*patch-work*" geometry), as well as the numerous ways they can interact with neighbouring ecosystems (i.e. flow of resources).**<sup>15-18</sup>** Perhaps the most important reason for studying and protecting <span id="Dpurp">ecotones</span>, like **oak savannas**, is because of the reported positive effects they have on species abundance and richness.**<sup>19-21</sup>** Certainly, from my own experiences at <span id="Dred">OPC</span>, the **oak savannas** do seem to attract certain bird species, like the **[Red-headed Woodpecker](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-headed_Woodpecker/overview)** (*Melanerpes erythrocephalus*) and **[Indigo Bunting](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Indigo_Bunting/overview)** (*Passerina cyanea*). Although my sightings of *M. erythrocephalus* have often been fleeting, my regular encounters with *P. cyanea* during the summer months have been anything but brief. These brilliantly colored songbirds are quite vocal when feeding on insects along the borders of the oak stands and as a consequence fairly easy to spot.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; So what are the forces that give rise to <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> in North America? The answer to this question revolves around three key factors, namely: **(i)** <span id="Blue">Climate</span>, **(ii)** <span id="Red">Fire</span> and **(iii)** <span id="Dbr">Grazing</span>.**<sup>22</sup>**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; **(i)** <span id="Blue">CLIMATE</span>: The history of southern Ontario's landscape has been largely shaped by ice. Multiple **Ice Ages** have come (*glacial*) and gone (*inter-glacial*) since the latter part of the **[Pleistocene epoch](https://stratigraphy.org/chart)**.**<sup>23</sup>** The last of these glaciation events, known as the **Wisconsin**, peaked at around 20,000 years ago (**ya**). Following this glacial maximum the climate quickly (geologically speaking) warmed resulting in the **Laurentide Ice Sheet** retreating back towards the pole. Scientists have pieced together the time-line of many past glaciation events by measuring the isotopic signature of certain chemical elements within the layers of core samples taken from glacial ice and ocean bottom sediments. One particularly informative element is <span id="Red">O</span>xygen (<span id="Red">O</span>). This building block of water (<span id="Blue">H</span><sub>2</sub><span id="Red">O</span>) has **[three stable isotopes](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat3/)** that vary in abundance (<sup>16</sup><span id="Red">O</span> = 99.757%, <sup>17</sup><span id="Red">O</span> = 0.038%, and <sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span> = 0.205%).**<sup>24</sup>** Moreover, as the Nobel laureate **Harold Urey** (1947) pointed out:  

>"*We now know that isotopes and isotopic compounds differ in their thermodynamic properties ...these small differences make possible the concentration and separation of the isotopes of some of the elements and may have important applications as a means of determining the temperatures at which geological formations were laid down*."**<sup>25</sup>**

The ability to detect slight differences in the mass of these isotopic compounds was only made possible through the development of mass spectroscopy by **Alfred Nier** and his colleagues in the late 1940s.**<sup>26</sup>** Knowing that heavier water molecules (<span id="Blue">H</span><sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span>) are less reactive and tend to evaporate more slowly and condense (e.g. fall as rain) more quickly than their lighter counterparts (<span id="Blue">H</span><sub>2</sub><sup>16</sup><span id="Red">O</span>), **Urey** and his colleagues were able to show that the proportions of oxygen isotopes do indeed change over time.**<sup>27</sup>** 
As **Urey** (1951) clearly stated himself in one of his seminal publications:  

>"*...the natural variations in the abundances of the lighter isotopes makes possible, in principle at least, quantitative measurement of paleotemperatures*."**<sup>27</sup>**

Today, examining the proportions of isotopic oxygen within the calcite (<span id="Ly">Ca</span>**C**<span id="Red">O</span><sub>3</sub>) shells of fossil **Foraminifera** is one of the most powerful tools (i.e. **[chemical proxy](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/climate-research-and-development-program/science/paleoclimate)**) for reconstructing past climate regimes. 

Because these single celled organisms make carbonate shells using the surrounding seawater and that they due so by selecting 

link between the temperature of calcification and the fractionation of oxygen isotopes in carbonates





the ratio of oxygen isotopes (δ<sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span>) can provide information about the environment it once inhabited (i.e. uptake of isotopic oxygen is temperature dependent). 

temperature dependence of 18O fractionation in biogenic calcite

A record of these past climate events are actually preserved within the fossilized remains of marine organism known as **Foraminifera**. The calcium carbonate in sea water is used by these organisms to build their shells and temperature therefore contains a unique chemical signature corresponding to the time when they were formed. 

<!-- Delta-18-oxygen calculation -->

where <strong>R</strong> = <sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span>/<sup>16</sup><span id="Red">O</span>

</div>

  

In fact scientists have recently reconstructed climate variations (i.e. temperature, ice volumes) over the past 5.3 million years by examining the oxygen isotope ratio (δ<sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span>) of these **foraminiferal** calcite samples from deep sea marine sediments **<sup>24-26</sup>**. 

The δ18O depends mainly on the isotope ratio of the water it is precipitated from, the temperature of calcification, and, to a lesser extent, the carbonate ion concentration. Foraminifera and other organisms can potentially preserve their original isotope ratio for many millions of years, although diagenetic processes can alter the ratios. Work on oxygen isotope ratios of foraminifera was instrumental in the discovery of the orbital theory of the ice ages and continues to be widely used in the study of rapid climate change. Compilations of deep sea benthic foraminifer oxygen isotopes have revealed the long history of global climate change over the past 100 million years.

The **foraminiferal calcite** 
Time series of the d18O of foraminiferal calcite tests provide an important record of climate change. Foraminiferal d18O is a function of the temperature and d18O of the water in which it forms, and the d18O of seawater is a function of global ice volume and water salinity. 

suggests that these temperature variations since the late **Pleistocene** are likely the result of 

Glacial cycles are commonly characterized using the of foraminiferal calcite, which measures global ice volume and ocean temperature. Previous

According to geologists this climate shift triggered a new **epoch** approximately 11,700 years ago, called the **[Holocene](https://stratigraphy.org/chart)<sup>23</sup>**. 

The Pleistocene has been characterized by significant temperature variations (through a range of almost 10°C) on time scales of 40,000 to 100,000 years, and corresponding expansion and contraction of ice sheets. These variations are attributed to subtle changes in Earth’s orbital parameters (Milankovitch cycles), which are explained in more detail in Chapter 21. Over the past million years, the glaciation cycles have been approximately 100,000 years;

By the end of the [Pliestocene](https://stratigraphy.org/chart) the giant **Laurentide Ice Sheet** had receded far to the north. And as the tundra-like vegetation that hugged the southerly flanks of these ice sheets also moved north, the void they left behind was filled by the more temperate grassland and forest communities.  

And for the first 3,000 years or so of the new (current) [Holocene epoch](https://stratigraphy.org/chart), much of the landscape of southern Ontario and the mid-Northwestern states were largely covered by spruce forests. However, ~9,000 **ya** the climate started to become warmer. This unusually dry period lasted for about 4,000 years and is often referred to as the <span id="Blue">H</span>olocene <span id="Blue">C</span>limate <span id="Blue">O</span>ptimum (<span id="Blue">HCO</span>). The timing of these glacial and inter-glacial periods over the last 400,000 years or so have been greatly 

as a result of cyclic changes in the earth's orbit (i.e. [Milankovitch cycles](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/)). 

is thought to have allowed prairie vegetation to move further eastward, displacing the forests that once occupied the central and north-eastern states, as well as southern Ontario **<sup>14, 15</sup>**. 

A period of cooling and a gradual increase in rainfall followed this warming stage allowing forest species and a variety of herbaceous and grass species fiom the deciduous forest region of the southeastern United States to re-invade the prairie (Faber-Langendoen, 1984)

In Minnesota, prairie vegetation such as grasses (Gramineae) and sagebrush (Artemisia) expanded eastward into forested regions of the state between about 8500 and 4000 years ago as climate became more arid (3, 4). 

&nbsp; &nbsp; Here in North America the dry conditions associated with the great western prairies are a product of the Rocky mountains' <span id="Db2">rain shadow</span>. This mountain chain acts as a natural barrier to the prevailing westerly winds. As a result, humid air masses coming in from the Pacific ocean are forced to ascend the Rockies. As the air reaches these higher elevations it cools, and as a consequence its ability to hold water vapour is greatly reduced. In essence, the Rocky mountains "*milk*" the air of its moisture causing precipitation or rain. The "*milked*" maritime air mass now descends the mountains along their eastern (leeward) slopes, warming up in the process as it becomes compressed by the higher pressures at these lower elevations. This warm dry air mass dominates the region limiting the type of vegetation that can grow here (i.e. drought resistant short-grasses). However, as one moves further east across the "*Great Plains*" the rain shadows' influence diminishes and, as a result, soil conditions improve (i.e. depth, moisture, nitrogen levels). These more favourable growing conditions result in more lush vegetation (i.e. both woody and herbaceous plants). Again, climate is the key driving force, particularly the amount of precipitation and evaporation that the occurs here. While these climatic conditions still favour tough prairie type vegetation, the increased soil depth and higher moisture levels allow taller grasses to grow and more hardy species of trees, like oaks, to take root. Continuing further eastward, the short grasses begin to give way to taller grasses. Trees now appear, at first singularly and sparse in number, but eventually together in distinct assembles (i.e. savannas and woodlands). 


Around the mid-western region is again largely a product of climate. The main climatic players here are opposing air masses, namely the cold continental Arctic (cA) air mass out of the north and the warm Maritime Tropical (mT) air mass out of the south (Fig. X). These two air masses clash with one another throughout the year over most of the continent, creating weather fronts that we have come to either love or hate on our off week days. Meanwhile, the eastbound mP air mass, or westerly winds, is wedged between these two converging air masses and together they create a precipitation and evaporation regime that perhaps best explains the existence of the ‛Prairie Peninsula’. This term was coined by Transeau (1935), who clearly recognized the usefulness of the iso-climatic lines of precipitation-evaporation ratios with regards to mapping the extent of prairie across the continent’s interior.   

The climatic conditions that allowed tallgrass prairies and oak savnnas to bless the shores of southern Ontario dates back roughly 9,000 to 5,000 years ago, a period of time that paleoclimatologists generally refer to as the Hypsithermal or Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM).  This is when the northern hemisphere experienced slightly warmer temperatures, due to cyclic changes in earth's orbit, specifically its obliquity (axle tilt), which directly influences the amount of incident solar radiation (i.e. insolation) hitting the earth (for more details see: section 2.2.1).  Local variations in the exact timing of the HTM were likely influenced by the proximity of the receding but substantial volumes of ice 9,000 years ago.  For example, reconstruction of the post-glacial vegetation regime using pollen and fossil records of a former Oak savanna in southern Ontario show clear transitions in vegetation types over the past 12,000 years [J. M. Szeicz, 1991 #32].  This study showed that the site was once dominated by open Pine woodlands, initially Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana) between 10,000 and 9,000 ya followed by White Pine (Pinus strobus) between 10,000 and ~6,000 ya.  However, some time between 8,000 and 6,000 ya the open P. stobus forest gave way to Oak savanna, a situation that lasted until ~1850 A.D. when Europeans systematically cleared the land for farming [J. M. Szeicz, 1991 #32].  

These changes in geography, climate and soil geology (*see: section 2.1) are not the only factors that have played an important role in maintaining prairie-savanna communities.  Grazing and fire have also had a hand in shaping these now endangered habitats.  Herds of bison that once numbered in the 10s of millions before being hunted to near extinction, cropped large swaths of grassland as they migrated across it, including parts of southern Ontario (Campbell 1997).  The grazing activities of these and other prairie herbivores actually stimulated the growth of plants, particularly the dominant grasses (family Poaceae) that have evolved, hand-in-hand, with the feeding habits of these grazers.  Grasses are one of the hardiest plants on the planet, capable of thriving in the face of severe disturbances (i.e. fire, draught, grazing, flooding) because of their phenomenal regenerative capacity.  The grasses vegetative (i.e. asexual) growth, which takes place in defined structures located at or near the soil surface (i.e. basal meristems), allows them to quickly sprout in response to various types of disturbances.  Many grasses are also capable of reproducing asexually via horizontal stem structures located above (i.e. stolons) and below (i.e. rhizomes; Greek: ῥίζωμα = rootstalk) the ground.  As the grasses grows upward and mature, a new type of growth centre develops at the top of the plant (i.e. apical meristem), which will eventually produce seeds via sexual (not asexual) reproduction.  So grazing, which removes the tender and most desirable tops of the plant (i.e. new growth), including the apical meristems, actually stimulates new growth from the more mature vegetative meristems located at base of the plant.


As mentioned above, prairie plants, particularly grasses are superbly adapted to tough environmental conditions, including seasonal fluctuations in groundwater levels, limiting nutrient levels (i.e. low nitrogen), grazing and other physical disturbances, most notably fire.  In fact, fire is considered a key natural regenerative mechanism in prairie-savanna communities.  Prairie plants and many types of savanna oaks are draught and fire resistant, owing in large part to their deep and extensive underground root system.  Disturbance regimens, particularly intermediate levels of disturbances, such as annual spring fires in the case of prairies and savannas, or forest openings created by occasional wind-storms, often stimulates biodiversity and increases the productivity of ecosystems.  For many of the most dominant tallgrass prairie species, the ability to grow back year after year largely depends on fire, since it: (i) eliminates invasive, fire-intolerant, non-native prairie species, (ii) removes any dead, slowly decomposing plant matter, (iii) warms the ground directly and indirectly by lowering the lands albedo (i.e. amount of reflected sunlight, which is decreased by the ash and blackened earth), and (iv)  keeps the land open and restricts the amount of available nitrogen, conditions that are advantageous for sun-loving prairie plants [Tilman, 1992 #14][Tilman, 1996 #13].  Large open wind swept plains with plenty of dead litter from the previous growing season is ideal fodder for spring fires, a product of both lightening strikes and historical land management practices by aboriginal people.  Unfortunately, the suppression of fire over the past two centuries by European settlers has contributed greatly to the wide spread loss of prairie and savanna habitat.  

The lightly treed oak savannas are natural transitional communities, or ecotones, that link treeless grass plains with thick deciduous forests.  The term biome refers to a rather large geographical area that shares similar vegetation and climatic conditions.  Moreover, these two neighbouring ecosystems are actually considered part of the greater grassland biome, and together with the other great biomes of the world make up one global web of life, or biosphere.  This continuity among living communities from one pole to the other may help to explain some of the problems with imposing rigid, albeit ecological relevant borders, particularly when even a relatively modest sized nature preserve, such as OPC, can hold so much natural variety, from low-lying wetlands and lagoons to wet and dry prairies, open oak savannas, and dense Carolinian forests.  Even scientists argue over how best to define these unique biological communities.  For example, under the most basic scientific scheme there are at least three different types of prairies based on the dominant type of grass species found within its borders.  Short-grass prairies, which generally occupy the dry, western most portions of the grassland biome, naturally cover uplands or hilly regions whose well drained soils typically supports Side-oats Gamma grass (Bouteloua curtipendula), as well as forbs (i.e. herbaceous flowering plants) such as Purple Prairie-clover (Dalea purpurea) and Cylindric Blazing-star (Liatris cylindracea).  Mixed-grass prairies, which mark the transition from dry to wetter climes, have deeper soils with higher moisture levels that can support Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans, Fig. X) and forbs such as Rough Blazing-star (Liatris aspera, Fig. X), and Round-headed Bush-clover (Lespedeza capitata, Fig. X).  Lastly, tall-grass prairies, which inhabit the eastern most parts of the grassland, are blessed with plenty of rainfall, deep soils and a wide variety of plant species.  Some of the more common grass species found here include Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardi, Fig. X) and Cordgrass (Spartina pectinata, Fig. X), and numerous forbs such as Dense Blazing-star (Liatris spicata, Fig. X), Culver's-root (Veronicastrum virginicum, Fig. X), New England Aster (Aster novae-angliae, Fig. X) and Butterfly Milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa, Fig X).
	Nevertheless, ecologists and conservationists alike use terms such as biome, tallgrass prairie or savanna to better define, catalogue, understand and ultimately protect these rare biological communities. Given that the border separating these terrestrial ecosystems are often blurred, even the simplest prairie classification schemes may be inadequate to achieve these goals.  Thus, ecologists are using finer scaled descriptors to better understand these dynamic living systems. This seems appropriate considering that even small functioning tracts of tallgrass prairie, like OPC, are actually a mosaic of seasonally wet and dry plains and depressions, marshes, oak savannas and more densely wooded areas. As a result, even tallgrass prairie communities can be further classified into different types based on differences in soil moisture, terrain and flora composition. Wet tall-grass prairies are noted for their saturated soils include wet, mesic, dry-mesic, dry and sandy tallgrass prairie types.


**2. ECOLOGY AND GEOLOGY OF OPC**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Ontario's ecological land classification systems <span id="Dred">OPC</span> makes up part of the western most boundary of the **Essex Ecodistrict** (**7E-1**) **<sup>11,12</sup>**. The ecoregion's characteristic flat terrain is largely due to the actions of glacial ice and meltwater between 75,000-to-10,000 years ago (i.e. late [Wisconsin glacial period](https://opentextbc.ca/geology/chapter/16-1-glacial-periods-in-earths-history/)). One of the most notable geological features that was generated during this time is the extensive layers of sandy and clay-like material that <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is situated on (i.e. **St. Clair Clay Plain**). This glacial debris has greatly influenced soil development at <span id="Dred">OPC</span> and consequently the variety of plants and animals that it can support.
