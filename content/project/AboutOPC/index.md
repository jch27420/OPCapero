&nbsp; &nbsp; As shown in the map above <span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) is composed of five distinct areas: (i) **Ojibway Park** (~61.5 ha); (ii) **Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve** (105 ha); (iii) **Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** (~15.6 ha); (iv) **Spring Garden ANSI** (~117 ha); and (v) **Black Oak Heritage Park** (~50.6 ha). Collectively these areas are home to at least 160 rare plant and animal species within Ontario, which is more than any other site in the province.**<sup>1,2</sup>** Today, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> represents one of the last major remnants of **[Tallgrass Communities](https://tallgrassontario.org/wp-site/)** (<span id="Gr2">TGC</span>) remaining in the province that is certainly in need of our protection.**<sup>3-8</sup>**

**1. HISTORY OF PRAIRIES IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Prior to European settlement **prairies** covered much of North America's heartland, stretching from the northern plains of Canada's prairie provinces to south and central Texas. Looking eastward, these grasslands extended from the dry foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the large stands of deciduous forest just east of the mighty Mississippi river. A notable feature of this great grassy plain was the *triangular* shape of its eastern border, often referred to as the <span id="Dpurp">Prairie Peninsula</span>.**<sup>9</sup>** This neck-like extension of mid-western prairie once covered most of Iowa and northern Missouri, large parts of neighbouring Illinois (known as the Prairie State), as well as portions of Indiana and Ohio. In addition, substantial patches of **prairie** and **oak savanna** could be found amongst the eastern forests and wetlands just beyond the peninsula's formal borders. A good example of this would be the western end of the Lake Erie. Many eye witness accounts from the early 1800s tell of a large lake plain with extensive swamp forests, oak woodlands and wet prairies.**<sup>10</sup>** As the famed naturalist Harold Mayfield once stated:  

>"...*Few people today realize the original extent of wet grasslands in this region. One continuous strip extended almost without a break from Sandusky Bay around the southwest corner of Lake Erie and up the western shore almost to Detroit. An early observer estimated the area of this tract at more than 200,000 acres* [>800 km&#178;]."**<sup>10</sup>**  

In southern Ontario many early explorers and surveyors also discovered large tracts of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> bordering the Great Lakes (i.e. Erie, Ontario, Huron) as well as other inland waterways (i.e. Lakes St. Clair and Rice; Detroit, St. Clair, Thames and Grand rivers). For example, the famous Flemish friar Louis Hennepin (1679) described the banks of the Detroit river as:  
>"...*the country between those two Lakes* [Erie and Lake St. Clair] *is very well situated, and the soil fertile. The banks of the streight* [Detroit River] *are vast meadows, and the prospect is terminated with some hills covered with vineyards*."**<sup>11</sup>**  

Antoine de Lamothe-Cadillac (1701), founder of Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit, also had a favourable view of the Detroit river:  

>"...*Detroit is, probably, only a canal or a river of moderate breadth ...through which the sparkling and pellucid waters of Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron (which are so many seas of sweet water) flow and glide away gently and with a moderate current into Lake Erie, into the Ontario or Frontenac, and go at last to mingle in the river St. Lawrence with those of the ocean. The banks are so many vast meadows where the freshness of these beautiful streams keep the grass always green*."**<sup>12</sup>**  

Even today the names of some settlements remind us of the southern Ontario's past grassland glory (e.g. Prairie Siding - just west of Chatham; Plainville - just south of Rice Lake).  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altogether, it is estimated that between 800 and 2,000 km&#178; of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> once covered parts of southern Ontario's landscape.**<sup>2-5</sup>** Regardless of "*true*" extent of these original grassland communities the rapid lost of these habitats to urban and agricultural developments some two centuries ago seems to have also erased our collective memory of them. For you would be hard pressed to find anyone who knows that these rare ecosystems even exist today. All toll less than 2% of North America's original tallgrass prairie remains today.**<sup>3,4</sup>** Unfortunately, the situation is far worse for **oak savannas**. These "*parkland*"-like areas, that once covered an estimated 12,000,000 ha of the north-central United States alone, are now almost all gone (i.e. ~0.1% remains).**<sup>13</sup>**  

**2. ECOLOGY OF TALLGRASS COMMUNITIES AT OPC**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; The term "*Tallgrass Communities*" (<span id="Gr2">TGC</span>) refers to the types of plants and animals found in these ecosystems (i.e. unique mix of tallgrass prairie and oak savanna). These rare habitats of eastern North America are home to hundreds of herbaceous plant species (i.e. grasses, sedges, forbs). And as the name suggests they are dominated by tall grasses such as **Big bluestem** (*Andropogon gerardi*), **Prairie Cordgrass** (*Sporobolus michauxianus*) and **Little bluestem** (*Schizachyrium scoparium*). Many smaller **sedges**, another <u>grass-like</u> plant, as well as hundreds of flowering plant (**forbs**) species can also be found in <span id="Gr2">TGC</span>. For example, the beautiful yellow **Tall Coreopsis** (*Coreopsis tripteris*), showy pink **Canadian tick-trefoil** (*Desmodium canadense*) and dazzling magenta spike of the **Dense Blazing star** (*Liatris spicata*) are all commonly found at <span id="Dred">OPC</span> during the peak summer months. This abundance of **forbs** also provides food for a variety of pollinating insects, including many that require a specific plant species to complete their life cycle (e.g. Monarch butterfly and Milkweeds). The **savanna** component of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> refers to "*parkland-like*" areas (i.e. varying tree canopy cover, usually 10-to-35%) that are dominated by both woody and herbaceous plants. The dominant woody species of <span id="Dred">OPC</span>'s savannas are **Pin oak** (*Q. palustris*) and **Black oak** (*Q. velutina*), but others such as **Bur oak** (*Q. macrocarpa*) and **White oak** (*Q. alba*) also reside here. The herbaceous plants of these savannas are predominately prairie species, but some forbs are **savanna** specialists. For example, the beautiful but hemi-parasitic **[Smooth Yellow False Foxglove](https://www.ontario.ca/page/smooth-yellow-false-foxglove)** (*Aureolaria flava*) harvests some water and nutrients from the roots of neighbouring **oak** trees.**<sup>14</sup>** Although *A. flava* is capable of photosynthesis these parasitized resources presumably helps the plant survive some of the harsher conditions (e.g. occasional droughts, nutrient poor sandy soils) that are common to these regions.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; The *transitional* nature of **oak savannas** is what ecologists call an <span id="Dpurp">ecotone</span>. Conceptually these areas represent transitions (either sharp or more gradual) between adjacent but distinct ecological communities (e.g. open prairie and closed canopy forest).**<sup>15</sup>** For example, some of <span id="Dred">OPC</span>'s **oak savannas** connect open prairie to more heavily wooded areas, while other more isolated oaks look like small "*islands*" amid a sea of tall grasses and flowers. Needless to say, these types of transitional communities are complex owing to their varying sizes, shapes (e.g. "*patch-work*" geometry), and the ways they can interact with neighbouring ecosystems (i.e. flow of resources).**<sup>15-18</sup>** Perhaps the most important reason for studying and protecting <span id="Dpurp">ecotones</span>, like **oak savannas**, is because of the reported positive effects they have on species abundance and richness.**<sup>19-21</sup>** Certainly, from my own experiences at <span id="Dred">OPC</span>, the **oak savannas** do attract certain bird species, like the **[Red-headed Woodpecker](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-headed_Woodpecker/overview)** (*Melanerpes erythrocephalus*) and **[Indigo Bunting](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Indigo_Bunting/overview)** (*Passerina cyanea*). Although my sightings of *M. erythrocephalus* have often been fleeting, my regular encounters with *P. cyanea* during the summer months have been anything but brief. These brilliantly colored songbirds are quite vocal when feeding on insects along the borders of the oak stands and as a consequence fairly easy to spot.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; So what factors controlled the distribution of North America's original <span id="Gr2">TGC</span>? The answer to this question largely revolves around three things, namely <span id="Blue">Climate</span>, <span id="Red">Fire</span> and <span id="Dbr">Grazing</span>.**<sup>22</sup>**

**1.** <span id="Blue">CLIMATE</span>: The distribution of plant communities, both small and large (i.e. **biomes**), are largely controlled by temperature. And the history of southern Ontario's grasslands and other **biomes** has quite literally been shaped by ice. Multiple **Ice Ages** have come (*glacial*) and gone (*inter-glacial*) since the latter part of the **[Pleistocene epoch](https://stratigraphy.org/chart)**.**<sup>23</sup>** The last of these glaciation events, known as the **Wisconsin**, peaked at around 20,000 years ago (**ya**). Following this glacial maximum the climate quickly warmed resulting in the northerly retreat of the **Laurentide Ice Sheet** (<span id="Purple">LIS</span>). The time-line of these past glaciation events has been reconstructed using isotopic chemistry techniques applied to samples taken from glacial ice and ocean bottom (benthic) sediments. The **[three stable isotopes](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat3/)** of <span id="Red">O</span>xygen (<sup>16</sup><span id="Red">O</span> = 99.757%, <sup>17</sup><span id="Red">O</span> = 0.038%, and <sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span> = 0.205%)**<sup>24</sup>** are of particular interest since they are the building blocks of water (<span id="Blue">H</span><sub>2</sub><span id="Red">O</span>) and biogenic carbonates (e.g. fossil **Foraminifera** shells).**<sup>25</sup>** Although all three of the oxygen isotopes have the same number of protons and electrons (i.e. same chemical behaviour), they do have varying numbers of neutrons and therefore different masses (e.g. <sup>16</sup><span id="Red">O</span> = 16 atomic mass units). It is this difference in mass that gives isotopes slightly different physical-chemical properties. As geologist **Eelco J. Rohling** clearly states:

>"...*Molecules vibrate with a fundamental frequency which depends on the mass of the isotopes...the resultant differences...imply that bonds formed by light isotopes are weaker than those formed by heavy isotopes. Hence, as a rule of thumb, molecules comprised of the light isotopes react somewhat more easily than those comprised of the heavy isotopes*."**<sup>25</sup>**  

This difference in bond strength results in the '*fractionation*' of **isotopologes** (i.e. molecules that differ only in their isotopic composition) between any two substances (e.g. <span id="Blue">H</span><sub>2</sub><span id="Red">O</span> &ndash; <span id="Ly">Ca</span>**C**<span id="Red">O</span><sub>3</sub> system) or two phases of the same substance (e.g. liquid &#8644; vapour phases). **<sup>25</sup>** For example, the heavier <span id="Blue">H</span><sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span> tends to evaporate more slowly and condense more quickly than <span id="Blue">H</span><sub>2</sub><sup>16</sup><span id="Red">O</span>. More importantly, the fractionation of these two water **isotopologes** is <u>temperature dependent</u>.  

>"...*measuring the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of fossil foraminiferal calcite has been one of the most effective techniques for reconstructing ocean and climate conditions of past times*."**<sup>25</sup>**

Since the fractionation between calcite (<span id="Ly">Ca</span>**C**<span id="Red">O</span><sub>3</sub>) and water is a function of temperature, than one can use the ratio of oxygen isotopes (&delta;<sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span>) from fossil **Foraminiferal** shells to estimate the temperature of the seawater these single celled organisms once inhabited. The method for calculating &delta;<sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span> (seen below) is relatively straight forward. In fact, it hasn't changed since **Harold Urey**, the Nobel prize winning chemist who invented these oxygen isotopic methods, first introduced it back in the early 1950s.**<sup>26-30</sup>**  

<!-- Delta-18-oxygen calculation -->

</div>

The use of &delta;<sup>18</sup><span id="Red">O</span>, as well as other types of **[paleoclimate proxies](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/climate-research-and-development-program/science/paleoclimate-proxies)** (e.g. pollen and spores), has been particularly useful in determining the types of plant communities (i.e. **biomes**) that once populated North America since end of the last ice age ~11,700 **ya** (Note: designated end of the **[Pleistocene epoch](https://stratigraphy.org/chart)**). Studies of pollen from across the province show relatively rapid changes in vegetation during the early part of the **Holocene**.**<sup>31-35</sup>** Deglaciated areas that once supported **Spruce** (*Picea spp.*) and tundra-like (herbs and shrubs) vegetation gave way to **Jack Pine** (*Pinus banksiana*), **Paper Birch** (*Betula papyrifera*) and a minor mix of other species (e.g. **Oaks**, **Ashes**, **Elms**, **Beech**). By ~10,000 **ya** a wide band of forests had developed along the trailing edge of the retreating ice sheet that stretched from eastern Alberta and southern Saskatchewan down through the mid-west and north-eastern United States.**<sup>35</sup>**
However, by the **mid-Holocene** (~9,000 to 6,000 **ya**) the climate in North America became unusual warm and dry during the summer months.**<sup>35-37</sup>** This so-called <span id="Blue">H</span>olocene <span id="Blue">C</span>limate <span id="Blue">O</span>ptimum (<span id="Blue">HCO</span>) is thought to have been the major cause of the eastward expansion of the western prairie and the subsequent development of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> within southern Ontario. Cyclic changes in the earth's orbit (i.e. **[Milankovitch cycles](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/)**) appears to be the main cause of the **mid-Holocene** warming event, a process referred to as **orbital forcing**.**<sup>38-41</sup>** However, it is interesting to note that the timing of the <span id="Blue">HCO</span> varied across the north. A review of **Holocene** proxy data from across the western Arctic (140 sites) revealed that in Alaska and northwest Canada warming started earlier at around 11,000 **ya** (lasting ~2,200 years), while in the Hudson Bay region and the Canadian Arctic islands warming started ~7,300 **ya** (lasting ~3,100 years) and ~8,600 **ya** (lasting ~3,400 years), respectively.**<sup>42</sup>** Clearly regional factors played a role in modifying the timing of the <span id="Blue">HCO</span> (e.g. ocean currents, albedo and temperature affects of large remnant ice sheets around Hudson Bay). Nevertheless, by ~7,000 **ya** Ontario (now ice free) had undergone noticeable changes in the composition of its forests. Pollen studies shows that both cool mixed forests (e.g. **Birch**, **Beech**, **White Pine**, **Hemlock**, **Cedar**) as well as the more southerly deciduous forests (e.g. **Sugar Maple**, **Ash**, **Oaks**, **Beech**, **Hickory**, **Chestnut**) had advanced further north beyond their current ranges.**<sup>31-35</sup>** The relatively stable levels of herbaceous plant pollen (i.e. grasses and forbs) during this time also suggests that open forested areas, like oak savannas, were part of the province's landscape. By the end of the <span id="Blue">HCO</span> (~4,000 **ya** to present) the climate in Ontario (and the rest of the continent) became cooler and wetter resulting in the southerly retreat of both the cool-mixed and temperate deciduous forests.**<sup>31-35</sup>** This wetter climate may have allowed forests to invade some of the open areas and create a patch-work of vegetation types within the province.  

**2.** <span id="Dbr">GRAZING</span>: Herds of **Bison** that once numbered in the 10s of millions once cropped large swaths of grassland in the mid-western states and the prairie provinces. The grazing activities of these and other important herbivores (e.g. **Elk**, **Deer**) actually stimulates the growth of grasses. Grasses are one of the hardiest plants on the planet, capable of thriving in the face of severe disturbances such as drought, grazing, fire and floods. The grasses phenomenal regenerative capacity is due to the position of their vegetative (i.e. asexual) growth centers (i.e. basal **meristems**). Because they lie close to the soil surface they can quickly sprout in response to disturbances that affects any part of the plant's higher structures. In addition, many grasses also possess horizontal stem structures called **stolons** that are located just above or below (**rhizomes**) the ground. If left intact the grasses can then grow and mature, producing a new type of growth center at the top of the plant (i.e. **apical meristem**) that can produce seed via sexual reproduction. So grazing, which removes the tender and most desirable tops of the plant, actually stimulates new growth from the more mature vegetative **meristems** located at base of the plant -- a win-win for both plant and herbivore. 

**3.** <span id="Red">FIRE</span>: The

As mentioned above, prairie plants, particularly grasses are superbly adapted to tough environmental conditions, including seasonal fluctuations in groundwater levels, limiting nutrient levels (i.e. low nitrogen), grazing and other physical disturbances, most notably fire.  In fact, fire is considered a key natural regenerative mechanism in prairie-savanna communities.  Prairie plants and many types of savanna oaks are draught and fire resistant, owing in large part to their deep and extensive underground root system.  Disturbance regimens, particularly intermediate levels of disturbances, such as annual spring fires in the case of prairies and savannas, or forest openings created by occasional wind-storms, often stimulates biodiversity and increases the productivity of ecosystems.  For many of the most dominant tallgrass prairie species, the ability to grow back year after year largely depends on fire, since it: (i) eliminates invasive, fire-intolerant, non-native prairie species, (ii) removes any dead, slowly decomposing plant matter, (iii) warms the ground directly and indirectly by lowering the lands albedo (i.e. amount of reflected sunlight, which is decreased by the ash and blackened earth), and (iv)  keeps the land open and restricts the amount of available nitrogen, conditions that are advantageous for sun-loving prairie plants [Tilman, 1992 #14][Tilman, 1996 #13].  Large open wind swept plains with plenty of dead litter from the previous growing season is ideal fodder for spring fires, a product of both lightening strikes and historical land management practices by aboriginal people.  Unfortunately, the suppression of fire over the past two centuries by European settlers has contributed greatly to the wide spread loss of prairie and savanna habitat.  



This continuity among living communities from one pole to the other may help to explain some of the problems with imposing rigid, albeit ecological relevant borders, particularly when even a relatively modest sized nature preserve, such as OPC, can hold so much natural variety, from low-lying wetlands and lagoons to wet and dry prairies, open oak savannas, and dense Carolinian forests. Even scientists argue over how best to define these unique biological communities. For example, under the most basic scientific scheme there are at least three different types of prairies based on the dominant type of grass species found within its borders.  Short-grass prairies, which generally occupy the dry, western most portions of the grassland biome, naturally cover uplands or hilly regions whose well drained soils typically supports Side-oats Gamma grass (Bouteloua curtipendula), as well as forbs (i.e. herbaceous flowering plants) such as Purple Prairie-clover (Dalea purpurea) and Cylindric Blazing-star (Liatris cylindracea).  Mixed-grass prairies, which mark the transition from dry to wetter climes, have deeper soils with higher moisture levels that can support Indian grass (*Sorghastrum nutans*) and forbs such as Rough Blazing-star (*Liatris aspera*), and Round-headed Bush-clover (*Lespedeza capitata*). Lastly, tall-grass prairies, which inhabit the eastern most parts of the grassland, are blessed with plenty of rainfall, deep soils and a wide variety of plant species. Some of the more common grass species found here include Big Bluestem (*Andropogon gerardi*) and Cordgrass (*Spartina pectinata*), and numerous forbs such as Dense Blazing-star (*Liatris spicata*), Culver's-root (*Veronicastrum virginicum*), New England Aster (*Aster novae-angliae*) and Butterfly Milkweed (*Asclepias tuberosa*). Nevertheless, ecologists and conservationists alike use terms such as **biome**, **tallgrass prairie** or **savanna** to better define, catalog, understand and ultimately protect these rare biological communities. Given that the border separating these terrestrial ecosystems are often '*blurred*', even the simplest prairie classification schemes may be inadequate to achieve these goals. Thus, ecologists are using finer scaled descriptors to better understand these dynamic living systems. This seems appropriate considering that even small tracts of **tallgrass prairie**, like <span id="Dred">OPC</span>, are actually a <u>mosaic</u> of seasonally wet and dry plains and depressions, marshes, oak savannas and dense woodlots. As a result, even **tallgrass prairie communities** can be further classified into different types based on differences in soil moisture, terrain and flora composition. Wet tall-grass prairies are noted for their saturated soils include wet, mesic, dry-mesic, dry and sandy tallgrass prairie types.  

**2. ECOLOGY AND GEOLOGY OF OPC**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Ontario's ecological land classification systems <span id="Dred">OPC</span> makes up part of the western most boundary of the **Essex Ecodistrict** (**7E-1**) **<sup>11,12</sup>**. The ecoregion's characteristic flat terrain is largely due to the actions of glacial ice and meltwater between 75,000-to-10,000 years ago (i.e. late [Wisconsin glacial period](https://opentextbc.ca/geology/chapter/16-1-glacial-periods-in-earths-history/)). One of the most notable geological features that was generated during this time is the extensive layers of sandy and clay-like material that <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is situated on (i.e. **St. Clair Clay Plain**). This glacial debris has greatly influenced soil development at <span id="Dred">OPC</span> and consequently the variety of plants and animals that it can support.
