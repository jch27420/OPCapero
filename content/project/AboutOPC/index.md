&nbsp; &nbsp; <span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) lies nestled between the city of Windsor and the town of LaSalle in Southern Ontario, Canada. This ~350 hectare (ha) complex was once home to the town of Ojibway, which was annexed by the city of Windsor in 1966. Moreover, as the name suggests, it is part of the traditional territory of the Anishnaabeg people (i.e. **Three Fires Confederacy** of Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa) **<sup>1,2</sup>**.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; As shown in the map above this region is composed of five distinct areas, namely: (i) **Ojibway Park** (~61.5 ha); (ii) **Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve** (105 ha); (iii) **Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** (~15.6 ha); (iv) **Spring Garden ANSI** (~117 ha); and (v) **Black Oak Heritage Park** (~50.6 ha). Collectively they are home to more than 160 species of provincially rare plants and animals, more than any other site in Ontario **<sup>1</sup>**.

**1. HISTORY OF TALLGRASS COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ~350 hectares of <span id="Dred">OPC</span> represents one of the largest remnants of **[Tallgrass Communities](https://tallgrassontario.org/wp-site/)** (<span id="Gr2">TGC</span>) remaining in the province **<sup>3,4,5</sup>**. Historically, southern Ontario was home to between 1,100 and 2,000 km&#178; of <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> **<sup>2,4,6,7</sup>**. Needless to say, the ~3% of the province's remaining high quality <span id="Gr2">TGC</span> is critically endangered and in great need of our protection **<sup>8</sup>**.  

**2. ECOLOGY AND GEOLOGY OF OPC**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Ontario's ecological land classification systems, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> makes up part of the western most boundary of the **Essex Ecodistrict** (**7E-1**) **<sup>9,10</sup>**. The ecoregion's characteristic flat terrain was largely shaped by glacial ice and meltwater between 75,000-to-10,000 years ago (i.e. late [Wisconsin glacial period](https://opentextbc.ca/geology/chapter/16-1-glacial-periods-in-earths-history/)). One of the most notable glacial features of <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is the extensive layers of sandy and clay-like material that it and other parts of this ecoregion are situated on (i.e. **St. Clair Clay Plain**). This geological feature of <span id="Dred">OPC</span> has greatly influenced its soil development and consequently the variety of plants and animals that it can support.

**[Southern Great Lakes lowland forests](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ecosystems-ontario-part-1-ecozones-and-ecoregions)** <span id="Gr2">ecoregion</span>. and the much larger **Mixedwood Plains** <span id="Gr2">ecozone</span> . 

(i.e. [surficial geology](https://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/en/mines-and-minerals/geoscience/surficial-geology)) often through the action of glacial meltwater. For <span id="Dred">OPC</span> the large glacial lakes that once inundated the region left behind a large low-relief plain of sandy and
