&nbsp; &nbsp; <span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) lies nestled between the city of Windsor and the town of LaSalle in Southern Ontario, Canada. As the name suggests this ~350 hectare complex (**Black Oak Heritage Park**, **Ojibway Park**, **Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve**, **Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** and **Spring Garden ANSI**) is part of the traditional territory of the Anishnaabeg people (i.e. **Three Fires Confederacy** of Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa). The area was also home to other indigenous groups, including the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), Attawandaron (Neutral) and Huron (Wyandot).  
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a science educator and keen naturalist I have been inspired by my many visits to <span id="Dred">OPC</span>. The extraordinary nature of this site can not be overstated, particularly if you consider the fact that **[Tallgrass Communities](https://tallgrassontario.org/wp-site/)** (<span id="Fgr">TGC</span>) are among the most endangered ecosystems on the planet. Here in southern Ontario, the once thriving <span id="Fgr">TGC</span> have been largely replaced by urban and agricultural developments. Today, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is one of the last major remnants of <span id="Fgr">TGC</span> left in the province. All toll, it is estimated that less than 3% of the province's original extent of <span id="Fgr">TGC</span> still remains today[^1][^2]. What was so remarkable about visiting <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is the overwhelming sense that you are being transported back in time when prairies and oak savannas were common place and not the isolated small "*island*"-like habitats that they are today. Of course, the only way to truly understand how special these places are is to visit one like <span id="Dred">OPC</span>. To prepare for such a trip I suggest consulting the **[Ojibway Nature Centre](https://www.ojibway.ca/index.htm)** website.
