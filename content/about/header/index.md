&nbsp; &nbsp; <span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) lies nestled between the city of Windsor and the town of LaSalle in Southern Ontario, Canada. As the name suggests this ~350 hectare complex (**Black Oak Heritage Park**, **Ojibway Park**, **Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve**, **Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** and **Spring Garden ANSI**) is part of the traditional territory of the Anishnaabeg people (i.e. **Three Fires Confederacy** of Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa). The area was also home to other indigenous groups, including the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), Attawandaron (Neutral) and Huron (Wyandot). If you plan on visiting <span id="Dred">OPC</span> please consult the **[Ojibway Nature Centre](https://www.ojibway.ca/index.htm)** for more information about what you can expect to find there.
